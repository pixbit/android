		<span class="c1">
			This edition of the Bureau of Reclamation&rsquo;s (Reclamation) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Handbook has been developed in response to the Council on Environmental Quality&rsquo;s (CEQ) and the U.S. Department of the Interior&rsquo;s (Interior) implementing regulations on NEPA. These regulations state that each agency will interpret the provisions of NEPA as a supplement to its existing authority and as a mandate to view its policies and missions in the light of its national environmental objectives.
		</span>

	<p class="c4">
		<span id="bookmark3" class="c5 c1">1.1 Who It&rsquo;s For</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			This handbook has been designed as a guidance tool for use by all Reclamation staff. It should also be useful to applicants, contractors, tribal representatives, the general public, and others who may be involved in Reclamation&rsquo;s NEPA process, or those who develop environmental reports for Reclamation&rsquo;s use in preparing NEPA documents.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span id="bookmark4" class="c5 c1">1.2 What It Does</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			This handbook describes Reclamation guidance for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 United States Code [U.S.C.] 4321, et seq.), CEQ&rsquo;s Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500&ndash;1508), Interior&rsquo;s NEPA Regulations (43 CFR Part 46), and the Departmental Manual (DM) Chapter 516. This handbook draws these requirements together and provides guidance on how to apply them to Reclamation programs and activities. The Reclamation Manual NEPA Policy (ENV P03) refers to this handbook as the source of additional information on NEPA compliance for Reclamation. The handbook also presents and summarizes other related environmental laws and Executive orders (EO) which should be addressed during NEPA compliance.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			This handbook provides an overview of NEPA in chapter 2. Chapter 3 contains a general description of the requirements and procedures of NEPA. Chapter 4 provides information on integrating NEPA with other Reclamation activities. Specific information on categorical exclusion checklists (CEC), environmental assessments (EA), and environmental impact statements (EIS) can be found in chapters 5, 6, and 7, respectively. This organizational structure has been selected to allow the user to quickly locate specific, step-by-step information on the different levels of NEPA compliance. Chapter 8 addresses EIS content, and chapter 9 discusses the requirements of a record of decision (ROD). Chapters 10 arise in applying NEPA to Reclamation&rsquo;s Federal actions. Chapter 12 concludes the handbook with information on gaining additional assistance on NEPA issues.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In addition, various issues and special problems are discussed throughout the handbook. Where possible, solutions that have worked historically, or approaches that seem most reasonable, are recommended.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span id="bookmark5" class="c5 c1">1.3 What It Does Not Do</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The handbook does not replace the law, including case law, CEQ regulations, Interior regulations, the DM, or the Reclamation Manual for appropriate policy and procedures. Although this handbook has been written with these authorities in mind, if a conflict should be found between the handbook and these authorities, the authorities take precedence.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			This handbook will not answer every potential NEPA compliance question. Reclamation&rsquo;s activities can lead to situations that do not fit &ldquo;classic&rdquo; NEPA definitions. Regulatory, social, and political realities can complicate the application of NEPA to unusual situations. The handbook cannot, and does not try to, address every possible situation. It should be useful as a starting point in any situation, but there is no substitute for discussions of complex situations with experienced environmental staff within Reclamation, whether at the area, regional, or Denver offices. The regional offices and Solicitor&rsquo;s Office can also provide assistance when NEPA compliance issues or questions arise.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			This handbook is issued by the Policy and Administration Office of the Bureau of Reclamation. It will be reviewed periodically, modified, and reissued (in part or whole) by this office to reflect changes in environmental, Interior, and/or Reclamation regulations and policy.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation staff and managers should let Policy and Administration staff know if there are areas in the handbook that are not clear or not helpful. Revisions can occur any time there is an identified problem with the existing text. Mandated changes from higher level authorities and minor updates can be made quickly, as appropriate, and without extensive reviews. The most recently updated handbook is available at

		<span id="bookmark11" class="c5 c1">2.1 The Purpose of NEPA</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			When NEPA was signed into law in 1970, Congress and the President established a new environmental policy for Federal agencies. This new policy became part of each agency&rsquo;s mission. NEPA states its purposes (NEPA Section 2, 42 U.S.C.
		</span>
		<span class="c0 c1">&sect; 4321) as follows:</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c47 c37">
		<span class="c1">
			To declare a national policy that will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment;
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c47 c37">
		<span class="c1">
			To promote efforts that will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man;
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c47 c37">
		<span class="c1">
			To enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation; and
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c47 c37">
		<span class="c1">To establish a Council on Environmental Quality.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In addition, NEPA states in Section 101, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 4331(b):
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c47 c37">
		<span class="c1">
			In order to carry out the policy set forth in this Act, it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable means consistent with other essential considerations of national policy, to improve and coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources . . .
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In other words, Reclamation must be environmentally aware in looking at the relationship its planning actions, projects, and programs have with the human environment now and in the future.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In order to make NEPA effective, Congress directed that all &ldquo;policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this Act&rdquo; (Section 102, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 4332). NEPA established the CEQ to promulgate regulations to implement the Act.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4 c22">
		<span id="bookmark12" class="c5 c1">2.2 Federal Agencies&rsquo; NEPA Responsibilities</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			To the fullest extent possible, Federal agencies are required to use all practicable means (NEPA Section 101(b)) to implement the policy expressed in NEPA. Section 102 of NEPA addresses how agencies are to integrate consideration of environmental values into planning and decisionmaking (i.e., through use of a systematic interdisciplinary approach, development of methods and procedures, and preparation of EISs on major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment). Federal agencies must also consult with other Federal agencies having jurisdiction or expertise regarding the environmental effects of proposed Federal actions and make EISs available for public review and comment.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4 c22">
		<span id="bookmark13" class="c5 c1">2.3 The NEPA Process</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The NEPA process is defined by the CEQ NEPA Regulations (40 CFR, Section 1508.21) as &ldquo;all measures necessary for compliance with the requirements of Section 2 and Title I of the Act.&rdquo; The NEPA process applies primarily to the steps leading up to and including the preparation of environmental documents, required in Section 102(2)(C) of the Act. This environmental information is integrated into the planning process (see section 4.2 in chapter 4) and supports agency decisionmaking. The CEQ Regulations allow Federal agencies to supplement the NEPA procedures with agency procedures describing how compliance will be carried out for specific agency programs and activities. Interior&rsquo;s regulations (43 CFR 46) provide additional specific requirements and are further supplemented by DM Part 516.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Within Reclamation, NEPA compliance is the responsibility of all Reclamation employees, not just management or the environmental staff. Failure to carry out the NEPA process creates a risk of legal action. Most of the suits brought against Federal agencies related to NEPA are for infractions of NEPA procedures under the Administrative Procedures Act.

	<p class="c37 c158">
		<span id="bookmark14" class="c1 c23">2.3.1 What NEPA Does</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Compliance with NEPA is a Federal responsibility and involves the participation of Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies, as well as concerned and affected public in the planning process. NEPA requires full disclosure of the potential effects of major actions proposed by Federal agencies and accompanying alternatives, impacts, and possible mitigation. NEPA also requires that environmental concerns and impacts be considered during planning and decisionmaking so that steps may be more easily taken to correct or mitigate the impacts of an action. Once a project is implemented, it may be too late or too difficult to avoid or mitigate environmental effects without a substantial increase in the cost and the manageability of the project (i.e., irretrievable commitment of
		</span>
		<span class="c0 c1">
			resources). Compliance with NEPA results in more informed decisions and the opportunity to avoid or mitigate for potential environmental effects before an action is implemented.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span id="bookmark15" class="c0 c1 c23">2.3.2 What NEPA Does Not Do</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">

			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c1 c23">Prevent environmental impacts from occurring</span>
			<span class="c1">

				Guarantee how information will be utilized by the decisionmaker

			The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a unique responsibility to review the environmental effects of other Federal agencies&rsquo; actions under the authority of Section 309 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Section 309 requires EPA to review and publicly comment on the environmental impacts of any matter related to the duties, responsibilities, and authorities of EPA&rsquo;s administrator, including actions to which Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA applies. EPA has developed a rating system for these reviews (figure 2.1). If EPA&rsquo;s administrator determines that a proposed action is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health, welfare, or environmental quality, Section 309 requires that the determination be made public (generally in the FR) and referred to CEQ.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			EPA&rsquo;s review is carried out to ensure that an independent review of the environmental effects of Federal proposals occurs. EPA&rsquo;s reviews emphasize consultation with the lead agency and public disclosure of EPA actions and concerns. EPA does not have the authority to require changes to a NEPA document. However, Reclamation should work closely with EPA to resolve any issues that may result in less than adequate ratings.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Section 309 generally requires that EPA review and comment on the adequacy of the analysis, the environmental impacts of the proposed action, issues related to its duties and responsibilities, and potential violations of, or inconsistencies with, national environmental standard. The major elements of the Section 309 review are:

				If the regional or original reviewing office finds the proposed action in a draft EIS is &ldquo;environmentally unsatisfactory&rdquo; or that the information in the draft EIS is &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; to assess the potentially significant environmental impacts of the proposed action, EPA headquarters and CEQ will be notified.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The NEPA process is intended to clarify whether an action proposed by a Federal agency is a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and, if so, to disclose the potential impacts to the public and to agency decisionmakers. Action may be addressed by categorical exclusions (CE), while Federal actions that are clearly major require an EIS. An EA addresses those situations that are neither covered by CEs nor clearly require an EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Compliance with Section 102(2)(c) of NEPA is carried out through a formal process (see figure 3.1). When the courts find NEPA compliance to be inadequate, it is frequently because of procedural errors by the Federal lead agency. The courts will determine if Reclamation complied with the required process but will usually defer to Reclamation on issues of analysis and technical knowledge, provided that differing opinions are documented.

			3.1 Types of Environmental Reviews: Categorical Exclusion, Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact, Environmental Impact Statement
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			NEPA compliance is triggered by a discretionary Federal action that is subject to Reclamation control and responsibility (40 CFR 1508.18). The nature of the Federal action may be construction of a project, granting a permit, providing Federal funding, or any other action where a Federal decision is required. If no Federal action is being taken or proposed by Reclamation, no NEPA document is required.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Once it has been established that there is a proposed Federal action, the next step is to determine relevant environmental issues, the potential magnitude of environmental impacts, and the appropriate level of NEPA documentation. Based on an early evaluation of a proposed action&rsquo;s environmental effects, the documentation for the action can be placed in one of the following three categories.

		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The first (and simplest) type of environmental review is the CE. A CE applies to actions that have been determined not to individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. A CE excludes categories of Federal actions from further NEPA review because the actions within these defined categories have been determined to generally have no significant effect on the environment, have no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources, or have no extraordinary circumstances that are applicable. Reclamation recommends a completed CEC for every use of a Reclamation- specific CE. If all the questions on the CEC can be checked &ldquo;no&rdquo; (see chapter 5, figure 5.2), no further NEPA documentation is necessary. If &ldquo;uncertain&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is checked, an EA or EIS would be necessary.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Development of a new CE category must be approved by CEQ and published in the FR for public review and comment before it is finalized. There may be cases in which a CE appears to apply but, because of particular circumstances such as controversy, action-specific environmental circumstances, or cumulative effect in relationship to other actions, NEPA analysis and documentation in an EA or EIS may be necessary. Interior&rsquo;s CEs and list of exceptional circumstances are included in 43 CFR 46.210 and 46.215. Reclamation&rsquo;s CEs are listed in 516 DM 14.5.
		</span>

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A CE can only be used for actions specifically defined by the exclusion category. The CEs and the procedures for using them, including actions for which a CEC is and is not necessary, are discussed in chapter 5.

			The purpose of an EA is to allow the decisionmaker to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI). An EA is written for any action that may have effects that are uncertain, and for which it is uncertain whether an EIS may be required. An EA is used to identify the issues and the environmental effects. Based on the EA, a FONSI may be prepared if the EA has demonstrated that there are no significant impacts resulting from the proposed action; if not, an EIS will be initiated. In addition, an EA may be used for evaluating any potential agency action to assist in planning and decisionmaking.

		<span class="c1">
			An EA is a concise document prepared with input from various disciplines and interested parties that provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI. This conclusion cannot be reached without having knowledge of what the issues are, as determined by appropriate Federal, tribal, State, local, and public entities, as well as the general public. The decision to conduct the next level of evaluation (an EIS) can be made any time there is enough information to indicate that significant impacts may occur or that sufficient controversy (disputes over scientific conclusions or impacts of the action) about the impacts exists. Mere opposition is not controversy.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Scoping is required by NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1501.7). It is to be &ldquo;an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to a proposed action.&rdquo; It includes all types of information-gathering activities and should not be viewed as a process limited only to a public meeting forum. Information can be obtained in a variety of ways: contacts with other agency personnel, water districts, citizens groups, and other interested individuals and parties are all scoping activities.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Scoping activities should be flexible and tailored to the action being considered. For example, scoping activities for a CE may be limited to intra-agency (environmental, technical services, planning, water operations, etc., groups or staff within Reclamation) and interagency contacts such as those with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). If warranted by the action, it may be beneficial to contact additional individuals and groups for information.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Scoping activities can be tailored to a project&rsquo;s needs. For example, scoping activities for an EA would likely include the intra- and interagency contacts routinely made for a CE. Public scoping is not required for an EA, but if a project is more complex, it may warrant a media program to solicit input from the general public, using newspaper articles or Web site information. Some Reclamation regions, recognizing the benefits of involving the public early in the scoping process, require a public notice for the development of an EA. The action should dictate scoping activities, and if a public notice and/or public meetings facilitate information gathering, such activities are encouraged.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Scoping activities associated with an EIS may include any of the activities previously described and any others necessary to gather relevant information. For highly visible actions, a newsletter, or even a home page on the World Wide Web, may facilitate information gathering. According to NEPA regulations, a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS must be published in the FR prior to initiating scoping. However, some information gathering is usually necessary before publication of the NOI to ensure that the interested publics understand the action and can effectively provide additional information. Depending on the action, an NOI may be an effective tool to facilitate scoping at other levels of compliance, such as an EA.

		<span class="c1">
			Public meetings for scoping activities are not required. However, public meetings can be effective communication tools, as well as effective mechanisms for gathering information. The use of public meetings as a scoping tool is strongly encouraged. Scoping generally involves a series of intra-agency, interagency, and public meetings, or it may consist of a series of smaller meetings with interested groups, agencies, or even individuals, including those opposed to the proposed action. Scoping meetings should, to the extent practicable, be held in the project impact area. Interested Federal, tribal, State, and local agencies; interested citizens; and environmental groups should be invited to participate.

	<p class="c4">
		<span id="bookmark34" class="c0 c1 c23">3.5.3 Benefits of Scoping</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			At the beginning of this section, the purpose of scoping was described as information gathering. Scoping should also be viewed as a &ldquo;value-added&rdquo; interdisciplinary process. Effective scoping identifies the public&rsquo;s concerns and, together with agency considerations and input from technical staff, defines significant resource issues. Reclamation can then focus on the defined issues and avoid encyclopedic discussions of topics that are irrelevant to the proposed action. The more an analysis can be focused on significant resource issues, the better the exchange between the public and the decisionmakers. Issues that are not significant, or that have been covered in the other documents, should be handled by reference, or the depth of coverage should be reduced. Often, it is just as important to understand which resource issues are not significant as it is to identify which resource issues are.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Scoping aids in identifying issues defined in other environmental laws (i.e., Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), etc.). Staff can begin to lay the groundwork for coordinating and consulting with other Federal agencies with jurisdiction and expertise in these areas and integrating these analyses into the NEPA process. This helps prevent delays later in the NEPA process. Scoping is an especially important consideration whenever endangered species or cultural resources is involved. These issues can become major considerations with proposed actions, and the constraints associated with such considerations should be identified and addressed early in the scoping process. It is important that the Federal agency staff attending scoping (or cooperating agency) meetings are able to describe the requirements of all Federal laws within their jurisdiction.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Scoping activities help to identify interested and/or potentially affected parties. Where applicants are involved, it can bring them into the process to identify information needs, how other environmental reviews may be integrated into the NEPA document, and any major obstacles that could cause delays. Detailed records of contacts made during scoping activities become part of the project files and can become an important reference. Scoping can also assist in identifying resources for the study, including staff time, data, and funding.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			By defining significant resource issues, scoping activities help identify the geographical area potentially affected by the proposed action. Issues can often be associated with physical areas, although impact areas may vary by resource. For example, changes in dam operations may affect biological resources for many miles downstream, but the same changes could affect hydropower in several States. In some cases, scoping may reveal a new alternative to the project that was not previously considered by the agency.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In situations in which a non-Federal action involves a Reclamation decision that is the only Federal decision involved, and in which Reclamation&rsquo;s decision affects only a small portion of the overall action, it may be within reasonable agency discretion to limit the NEPA review to those parts of the action directly related to Reclamation&rsquo;s decision. This recognition of the overwhelmingly private nature of the action avoids the &ldquo;federalization&rdquo; of the action. Such a situation could, for example, involve proposals to cross Reclamation properties that are merely a link in a transportation or utility transmission project. Great care should be taken to ensure that the entire Federal relationship with the action (not just Reclamation&rsquo;s) has been analyzed before concluding that the appropriate scope of the NEPA analysis will not include the entire project. It is important to realize that the type of actions under discussion (where Reclamation&rsquo;s analysis could be limited) would not involve Reclamation project operations or Reclamation project water.

It is not always easy to seek out those with differing viewpoints, but it is an important part of the process to be aware of all points of view and to work with all concerned individuals and the public. Initial efforts spent listening and being open to other ideas should prevent many headaches later in the process.

			Reclamation&rsquo;s public involvement program should begin early so that environmental concerns can be discussed with the public as the plans are developed and evaluated. Early meetings may need to focus on how the NEPA process works and how the public can most effectively participate in that process. Consensus-based management, if appropriate, should be initiated at the earliest possible opportunity (43 CFR 46.110) (see Section 8.6, Description of Alternatives). Training on how to effectively participate in the NEPA process and discussion of any applicable adaptive management components may also be appropriate early in the public involvement process.

		<span class="c1">
			There are many ways to continuously involve the public in the NEPA process. None will answer all the concerns for involvement that the public may express. The greater the degree of public interest, the more expansive the continuing scoping efforts should be. Briefings, Web sites, newsletters, special issue groups, and regular attendance at local governmental meetings are just some of the many techniques that are available.
		</span>

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation environmental personnel and other relevant disciplines (the interdisciplinary team) should be involved early in the planning process. They can help identify important resources, opportunities, and potential difficulties and any known environmental constraints so conflicts can be avoided. For example, there may be endangered species or sensitive wetland areas that should be avoided, or there may be a nonstructural way to accomplish the project purpose and satisfy the identified needs.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			After Reclamation&rsquo;s environmental personnel are involved, other agencies with environmental expertise and/or legal jurisdiction (i.e., potential cooperating agencies) and potential partners should be identified and involved. When the project purpose and need have been defined, all appropriate publics should be contacted to identify their questions and concerns and to begin NEPA documentation.

			To the extent possible, Reclamation should encourage community representatives and stakeholders to reach consensus on issues at critical points throughout the NEPA process. This is not always practicable and feasible, especially on large and complex projects where there may be many diverse and competing interests. Reclamation has the responsibility to keep the NEPA process on track and make the final decision on a proposed action. However, an approach that encourages consensus (consensus-based management) may help avoid problems later on if interested parties are on board with the decisionmaking process.

Federal agencies with closely related decisions having the same general scope may also be invited to be cooperators, and an agency may request Reclamation to designate it as a cooperating agency. Non-Federal governmental entities, such as Indian tribes, local governmental entities, or States, can also be cooperators. It is advantageous to invite eligible governmental entities to become cooperators at the earliest opportunity. Reclamation must also respond to any requests for cooperating agency status. (See January 30, 2002, CEQ Memoranda, Cooperating Agencies in Implementing the Procedural Requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.)

The Reclamation office responsible for the NEPA document would respond to these comments as it would for any response to comments on NEPA documents. There is no process to appeal Reclamation&rsquo;s response to public comments on EISs under NEPA. However, under the IQA, a party may appeal a Federal agency response to the head of the agency if they remain dissatisfied with the quality of the data after the agency&rsquo;s corrections (if any).

Such cooperation includes joint planning, joint environmental research and studies, joint public hearings, joint EAs, and joint EISs.

		<span class="c1">
			To the fullest extent possible, the NEPA process will integrate the requirements of other statutes, such as the FWCA, NHPA, ESA, and other laws and EOs. The analytical process under these laws and concepts of no action, impacts, and scope may be described differently than under NEPA. It is important to recognize these differences and resolve them early in the process so that the environmental requirements are effectively addressed in one process with minimal redundancy. Environmental staff in the region, Policy and Administration, and the Solicitor&rsquo;s Office can provide assistance to the Reclamation program offices in determining which laws apply to specific actions and how consultation and analyses may be incorporated into the NEPA process.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Where possible, the analysis of impacts required by these other laws should be included in or appended to the NEPA document. A section should also be included in the document describing the consultation and coordination that took place with the agencies overseeing these laws. If compliance with these other laws is treated as a separate action, delays could occur, possibly leading to additional costs and damage to public relations. At a minimum, the status of compliance should be documented in any EA or EIS.
		</span>

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Special attention should be given to the integration of NEPA and the ESA. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires consultation with the Service and/or NOAA-NMFS for any Reclamation action which may affect a species federally listed as threatened or endangered (listed species). This consultation process may result in the Service and/or NOAA-NMFS issuing a biological opinion containing actions to be undertaken to avoid jeopardizing a species or to reduce the level of take associated with the proposed action. Reclamation shall, to the fullest extent possible, integrate ESA and NEPA analyses and schedules. There are several areas where, typically, issues have arisen that may not allow this integration of analyses. These are discussed below. The requirement to invite the Service as a cooperating agency (for an EIS), and the recommended MOU, should help integrate the respective schedules.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The initiation of Section 7 consultation requires the identification of a proposed Federal action. Therefore, consultation often is not initiated until the later stages of the NEPA process and usually only on the preferred alternative. This can create conflicts and delays in completing the NEPA process. Accordingly, it is important to provide a well-developed preferred alternative to the Service in a timely fashion. Consulting on multiple alternatives is not recommended because it can significantly increase the consultation timeframes. It is also useful, as appropriate, to maintain communications with the Service during the consultation process to address any questions that may arise.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A second consideration is that some of the actions emanating from an ESA consultation (i.e., agency commitments, reasonable and prudent alternatives [RPA], etc.) may require significant changes to alternatives; thus, a biological opinion received late in the NEPA process can confound the NEPA process by presenting actions that have not been fully evaluated. Ongoing communication with the Service and/or NOAA can assist in understanding these outcomes earlier in the process. It is possible that Reclamation may modify the proposed action as a result of a late biological opinion and be required to supplement the NEPA document. The integration of NEPA and ESA in a timely manner is best accomplished by close and careful coordination and cooperation between Reclamation and the Service and/or NOAA-NMFS as early as practical in the NEPA process.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Another consideration is the definition and use of the term &ldquo;baseline.&rdquo; The Section 7 implementing regulations state that the effects of a proposed action are added to the baseline to determine if the species is jeopardized by the totality of actions that may affect it. If a species would be jeopardized by the proposed action (in addition to all other actions), a jeopardy biological opinion would be issued. &ldquo;Environmental baseline&rdquo; is defined in Section 7 regulations (50 CFR 402.02): &ldquo;The environmental baseline includes the past and present impacts of all Federal, State, or private actions and other human activities in the action area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in the action area that have already undergone formal or early section 7 consultation, and the impact of State or private actions which are contemporaneous with the consultation in process.&rdquo; This definition is similar to the &ldquo;affected environment&rdquo; under the NEPA regulations. The environmental baseline sets the stage for determining potential effects upon listed species under ESA. The environmental baseline is not the same thing as the &ldquo;No Action Alternative&rdquo; under NEPA.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Finally, both ESA and NEPA must address cumulative effects, but the regulations for the two acts define the term differently. Under NEPA, the cumulative effects analysis includes the reasonably foreseeable effects of both Federal and non-Federal actions. Under ESA, cumulative effects include the effects of the proposed action and those future tribal, State, local, and private actions that are also reasonably certain to occur, but they do not include future Federal actions. This difference is another factor making true integration of NEPA and ESA analyses difficult.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			It is advised that the terminology being used in connection with NEPA and ESA on a particular project be clarified early on in the environmental compliance activities so as to meld these two processes as much as possible and to avoid unnecessary confusion.

		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In 1976, the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) established a management system to more effectively utilize the marine fishery resources of the United States. It established eight regional fishery management councils (Councils), consisting of representatives with expertise in marine or anadromous fisheries from the constituent States. As amended in 1986, the Magnuson Act required Councils to evaluate the effects of habitat loss or degradation on their fishery stocks and take actions to mitigate such damage. In 1996, this responsibility was expanded to ensure additional habitat protection.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			On October 11, 1996, the Sustainable Fisheries Act (P.L. 104-297) became law, which, among other things, amended the habitat provisions of the Magnuson Act. The renamed Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) calls for direct action to stop or reverse the continued loss of fish habitats. Toward this end, Congress mandated the identification of habitats essential to managed species and measures to conserve and enhance this habitat. The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires cooperation among NOAA-NMFS, the Councils, fishing participants, Federal and State agencies, and others in achieving the essential fish habitat (EFH) goals of habitat protection, conservation, and enhancement.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			EFH means those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity (Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). For the purpose of interpreting the definition of essential fish habitat: &ldquo;Waters&rdquo; include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties that are used by fish and may include aquatic areas historically used by fish where appropriate; &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; includes sediment, hard bottom, structures underlying the waters, and associated biological communities; &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; means the habitat required to support a sustainable fishery and the managed species&rsquo; contribution to a healthy ecosystem; and &ldquo;spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity&rdquo; covers a species&rsquo; full life cycle (EFH Final Rule, 67 FR 2343).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Consultation and coordination for EFH under the Magnuson-Stevens Act should be consolidated with interagency coordination procedures required by other statutes, such as NEPA, FWCA, ESA, and the Federal Power Act to reduce duplication and improve efficiency (50 CFR 600.920(f)). The use of existing environmental coordination and/or review procedures to meet the EFH consultation requirements is the preferred approach for EFH consultations. In Reclamation NEPA documents (EAs and EISs), an evaluation of impacts to essential fish habitat of anadromous or marine fisheries should be included under a separate subheading, either in the discussion of fisheries or, if there are listed anadromous fish in the project area, under the discussion of threatened and endangered species.

The guidelines are used by USACE in determining whether or not the proposal is consistent with Section 404 and whether or not to issue a 404 permit. EPA also uses them in its oversight responsibility when reviewing USACE&rsquo;s decisions.

The term &ldquo;waters of the U.S.&rdquo; is a heavily litigated term that frequently changes meaning. Practitioners should consult with the Office of the Solicitor if the Reclamation activity involves the discharge of dredged or fill material. An alternative is considered to be practicable if it is available and capable of being carried out after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of the overall project purpose.

The detailed information needed to prepare a 404 permit application is typically not available until a preferred alternative has been identified and the NEPA process is nearing completion. Being required to consider other alternatives (either new or previously eliminated alternatives) as a result of the public notice review process can cause delays in the project schedule. Therefore, it is imperative to engage the participation of key resource agencies in coordinating NEPA compliance activities (especially as they relate to the evaluation of alternatives). Resource agencies that routinely review 404 permit application public notices (State fish and game departments, EPA, the Service, and USACE) should be encouraged to participate in the preparation of the NEPA document as cooperating agencies so that 404 permit-related issues can be resolved in a timely manner.

			The steps for complying with Section 106 are defined in 36 CFR Part 800 and are commonly referred to as the Section 106 process. Briefly, steps include: identifying the area of potential effect (APE) of an undertaking; identifying historic properties through inventories, as needed; evaluating the significance of cultural resources within the APE; assessing the effect of the proposed undertaking on historic properties; and, if there is an effect, determining whether it is adverse. If adverse effects are identified, Federal agencies must evaluate alternatives or modifications to the undertaking that could avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effects. A finding of adverse effect on a historic property does not necessarily require the preparation of an EIS under NEPA.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A key component of the Section 106 process involves consultation with the appropriate SHPO or, for projects occurring on or affecting historic properties on tribal lands, the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer(s) (THPO). When an Indian tribe has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for Section 106 on tribal lands, the Federal agency must consult with a tribal government representative. Federal agencies must also provide adequate opportunities for public involvement and identify other parties with whom to consult throughout the process. Indian tribes must be consulted when they attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected by an undertaking. Tribes must be provided a reasonable opportunity to identify their concerns and articulate their views on possible effects and proposed mitigation measures. The consultation process can be time consuming and complex, depending on the nature of the undertaking.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation cultural resources management policy (LND P01) is to preserve historic properties in place to the fullest extent possible and attempt to avoid adverse effects to them. However, in some cases, Reclamation and the consulting parties may agree that no mitigation measures are possible and that the public benefits of proceeding with an undertaking outweigh the adverse effects to historic properties. In accordance with 36 CFR Part 800.6, resolution of adverse effects (and any agreed to mitigation) would be documented in a memorandum of action (MOA) signed by Reclamation, the SHPO/THPO, and other invited signatories. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), an independent Federal agency that promotes the preservation, enhancement, and productive use of our Nation&rsquo;s historic resources, may choose or be invited to join the consultation process. It is important to note that title transfers are subject to the Section 106 process and that under 36 CFR Part 800.5(a)(2)(vii), the &ldquo;transfer, lease, or sale of a historic property out of federal control without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure the long term preservation of the property&rsquo;s historic significance constitutes an adverse effect.&rdquo;
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Although the Section 106 process is independent of the NEPA process, 36 CFR Part 800.8 addresses the need for coordination between the two to reduce duplication of effort. Federal agencies are instructed to &ldquo;consider their Section 106 responsibilities as early as possible in the NEPA process, and plan their public participation, analysis, and review in such a way that they can meet the purposes and requirements of both statutes in a timely and efficient manner.&rdquo; Reclamation should include cultural resources in EAs and EISs by referencing the relevant cultural resource consultation processes and, if completed, referencing the finding of &ldquo;no historic properties affected&rdquo; if 36 CFR 800.4 applies, or the finding of adverse effect or no adverse effect if 36 CFR 800.5 applies. If all steps in the Section 106 process are not completed prior to finalization of NEPA documentation, the latter must contain commitments for Reclamation to fulfill its Section 106 responsibilities, generally in either an MOA or a programmatic agreement. In summary, the key to successfully integrating NHPA and NEPA is to address cultural resources at the earliest stages of planning an undertaking. Under amendments made to 36 CFR Part 800 in 1999, a Federal agency may use the NEPA process to comply with Section 106 if certain standards echoing its key components are met. This provision is intended to permit streamlining without sacrificing the main elements of the Section 106 process. If Reclamation selects this alternate process for meeting its Section 106 requirements, it must notify the SHPO/THPO and the ACHP in advance.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Even if an action is categorically excluded from NEPA review, Reclamation cultural resource staff must still determine if it qualifies as an undertaking requiring review under Section 106 (36 CFR 800.3). See chapter 5 for more information.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In addition to the NHPA, there are numerous other Federal laws that exist to preserve and protect the Nation&rsquo;s cultural heritage and with which Reclamation must comply. Among these laws are the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (P.L. 95-341), Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) (P.L. 96-95), Antiquities Act, and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (P.L. 101-601).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation will consult with appropriate Indian tribes when there are planned excavations on, and removal of, cultural items of tribal concern from Reclamation lands. All archaeological activities conducted by non-Federal entities and their employees require an ARPA permit prior to beginning the activity. In situations where the archaeological activities are on tribal lands, tribal consent and proof of consultation are required. In addition, an ARPA permit, issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), is required prior to beginning the activity on tribal lands.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Section 110 of the NHPA requires special consideration of National Historic Landmarks, including consultation with the ACHP and the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) when a landmark is to be adversely affected. When applicable, the identification and consideration of National Historic Landmarks should be incorporated into NEPA documents.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation has a programmatic agreement in place with the ACHP and the National Council of SHPOs to deal with responses to major natural disasters or national security emergencies.

			Indian Trust Assets (ITA) are legal interests in property held in trust by the United States for Indian tribes or individuals.

Under this policy, Reclamation is committed to carrying out its activities in a manner that avoids adverse impacts to ITAs, when possible, and mitigates or compensates for such impacts when it cannot avoid the impacts. All impacts to trust assets, even those considered nonsignificant, must be discussed in the trust analyses in NEPA documents and appropriate compensation or mitigation implemented.

		<span class="c1">
			CEQ has prepared guidance (Memorandum to Heads of Federal Departments and Agencies Regarding Pollution Prevention and the National Environmental Policy Act, 12 January 1993, in the attachments) to Federal agencies on how to incorporate pollution prevention principles into planning and decisionmaking and on how to evaluate and report those efforts in NEPA documents. This guidance does not include new requirements for the NEPA process but does suggest ways that pollution prevention should be incorporated into existing procedures.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			CEQ suggests that pollution prevention be specifically addressed when an EIS is scoped. This would encourage the identification of means to prevent pollution associated with an action.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Pollution prevention is defined in the guidance as any reasonable mechanism that avoids, prevents, or reduces pollutant releases other than traditional treatment at the discharge end of a pipe or stack. This definition is consistent with the definition in CEQ regulations for mitigation (40 CFR 1508.20). Accordingly, pollution prevention should be a component of early planning and decisionmaking on proposed Federal actions and addressed in NEPA documents. Each alternative should include pollution prevention measures, as appropriate and practicable, and these considerations should be discussed in the environmental consequences section of the EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			CEQ regulations require the ROD to include a statement of whether or not all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm have been adopted, and if not, why not, as well as a discussion of a monitoring and enforcement program, if appropriate (40 CFR 1505.2(c)). The ROD is viewed by CEQ as an appropriate means to inform the public of the extent to which pollution prevention is included as a component of Federal action.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			CEQ guidance focuses mostly on the appropriate discussion of pollution prevention in an EIS but also makes the point that a discussion of pollution prevention may also be appropriate in an EA.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In carrying out the NEPA process (either a CEC, FONSI, or ROD), Reclamation should maintain an administrative record to support its findings. Although the record may vary, it is commonly a chronological paper/computer trail tracing the NEPA process as it follows CEQ regulations for a particular action. The record may include, but is not limited to: planning documents, notices, documentation of scoping meetings, EA/EIS documents (draft and final) with supporting documents
		</span>

			Creation and maintenance of the administrative record as a discrete data set has positive advantages for ready access. The record facilitates Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests on agency actions. The record is an information resource for preparation of new NEPA documents and a source for elements to be tiered to, or incorporated by, reference. The administrative record also plays an important role in NEPA litigation. Sometimes, NEPA lawsuits involve challenges to an agency&rsquo;s decision not to prepare an EIS or the adequacy of an EIS. A plaintiff and reviewing court are generally not entitled to discover evidence or extend review beyond the administrative record if the record contains sufficient information to respond to the plaintiff&rsquo;s allegations.

			There are many benefits to having all finalized NEPA documents generated in a particular region sent to one central location in that region. In most cases, the most logical place for the repository would be in the regional office. It is recommended that each region establish a procedure that would place a copy of every EIS and every EA produced in the region in one location within the regional office. The inclusion of CECs would also be useful.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			FOIA requests are becoming commonplace, necessitating the efficient handling of substantial amounts of information. The regional offices are often given the responsibility to process these requests and, therefore, would benefit greatly from having the applicable NEPA documents readily available. Similarly, most legal actions are handled at the regional level, and the availability of applicable NEPA documents will facilitate any Reclamation involvement.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The regional offices generally take the lead on developing large-scale programmatic NEPA documents such as EISs.

			The latest procedures for implementing the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 were developed in 1983 as the P&amp;G. Copies are available from Policy and Administration. Note, however, that, as of the issuance of this handbook, the P&amp;Gs are currently under revision. Following is a link with the most recent information:

		<span class="c1">.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The P&amp;G evaluation criteria must be used in studies justifying authorization or reauthorization of federally funded water and related land resources implementation projects. The P&amp;G evaluations are not required for common resource management decisions such as:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="69">

			<span class="c1">Basinwide or ecosystem management studies</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In essence, if funding to implement a project is not being requested from Congress, the P&amp;G are not required. Although not required, the P&amp;G evaluation method is often used because of its acceptance and consistent application throughout the Federal water resources community.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The P&amp;G are followed for implementation studies (e.g., dam construction), which are conducted for projects authorized by Congress. Applying the P&amp;G ensures proper and consistent planning by Federal agencies in formulating and evaluating water resources studies. The P&amp;G and NEPA have a common goal&mdash;to &ldquo;examine all reasonable alternatives during project planning to provide the greatest public benefit and the least adverse environmental effect.&rdquo; Reclamation integrates the P&amp;G and NEPA to plan and evaluate projects in an organized and environmentally responsible manner. In this way, the purpose and policies of NEPA become a part of the planning process and are considered along with economic and engineering factors.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Special investigations and reports may include water management studies and fish and wildlife investigations that result in recommendations for construction or changes in management. Special investigations should include sufficient study of environmental aspects to make viable recommendations for either further study or for implementation of plans of action. If the special report only recommends further study, it would come under an Interior CE (43 CFR 46.210(e)), and no CEC is necessary. When a special report or investigation results in recommendations for action, an appropriate CEC, EA/FONSI, or EIS should be prepared. The level of environmental detail should be commensurate with the level of detail for other study aspects. When appropriate, the NEPA compliance document should accompany a special report through all decisionmaking levels.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Status reports may be prepared at any time during a planning investigation. As the name implies, a status report should set forth the status of the investigation and summarize the data collected and analyses made. Such a summary should include a discussion of the environmental data and the analyses to the extent that they have been completed. Since a status report would not include a recommendation for action, no NEPA compliance is required.

		<span id="bookmark75" class="c5 c1">4.5 Resource Management Plans</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation encourages the development of a resource management plan (RMP) for each significant Reclamation area to assist in future resource decisions. RMPs should include applicable sections on recreation, fish and wildlife, operations, cultural resources, ITAs, agriculture, and other special uses. The purpose of RMPs is to incorporate in one document all information pertinent to future management of the area. Included in the document is an analysis of the resources of the area, the identification of land use suitability and capability, the determination and designation of land use zones, and the development of management policies, objectives, responsibilities, guidelines, and plans. It is also useful to include copies of agreements, laws, EOs, rules and regulations, special reports, special plans, maps, and all other documents relevant to the management area. The refinement and complexity of the material to be included in the plan and its length are governed by the size, complexity, and importance of the area for which the plan is prepared and the alternative management actions being considered. Additional guidance on RMPs is available in Reclamation&rsquo;s Resource Management Plan Guidebook (
		</span>
		<span class="c17">
			<a class="c2" href="http://www.usbr.gov/recreation/publications/RMPG.pdf">
				http://www.usbr.gov/
				<br>recreation/publications/RMPG.pdf</a>
		</span>
		<span class="c1">).</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Since a properly prepared RMP should contain much of the information and analyses required by NEPA, the RMP and NEPA material should be developed concurrently. Much of the initial public involvement and resource inventory information can be used in the NEPA document. Either an EA or an EIS should be prepared, dependent upon the significance of the potential impacts. The draft EA/EIS evaluates all resource management alternatives, including the preferred alternative, and is submitted for public review prior to completion of the RMP. The final RMP and final EA/EIS may either be issued together upon completion of the review process, or the final RMP may be issued later. If there is strong public interest associated with the preferred alternative, it is best to wait to issue the final RMP for at least 30 days following the EA/FONSI or until after a ROD is issued.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			On projects that were subject to previous NEPA compliance, no additional compliance may be required for the approval of a new RMP unless there are substantial departures from the original development and management proposals or new data regarding significant effects upon the environment. Where minor changes are proposed after completion of the RMP, normally only those changes are subject to additional NEPA compliance and may qualify as a CE. Often, the original NEPA document is programmatic and indicates that followup NEPA compliance will be carried out for site-specific projects.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c51 c37">
		<span id="bookmark76" class="c5 c1">4.6 Construction Activities</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			While some construction activities are covered by CECs or EAs, those for major Reclamation projects and programs are ordinarily covered by project or programmatic EISs. From time to time during construction, it is necessary to modify construction features after filing an FEIS. Such structural modifications may result in a different set of environmental impacts. Reclamation shall evaluate the environmental consequences of such structural or location changes. Based on the amount of change and its relationship to the environmental consequences, the appropriate NEPA compliance document shall be completed.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Other construction activities are carried out for regional programs or specific projects and may not have prior NEPA documentation. These could include repair of existing facilities or additions to authorized projects. While some of these activities may be considered as categorically excluded (40 CFR 1508.4), many minor construction activities may not qualify for CEs because the impacts are unknown or may be significant. The CEC should be used to determine if the proposed action qualifies as a CE and to decide if additional NEPA documentation is needed.

		<span id="bookmark77" class="c5 c1">4.7 Safety of Dams</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The modification of existing dams for safety purposes can cause environmental impacts. The impacts can vary from the traditional O&amp;M impacts, which are usually categorically excluded, to impacts associated with repairing, modifying, replacing, or breaching dams. The potential significance of the environmental impacts caused by repairing, modifying, replacing, or breaching would determine if a CE, preparation of an EA, or EIS would be appropriate. If the action does not fit a CE category or extraordinary circumstances exist which would disqualify the action for a CE, then an EA should be prepared to determine the significance of the impacts of the proposed action, unless it is apparent that an EIS is required. It should be noted that many of Reclamation&rsquo;s dams and associated facilities are historic, and NHPA consultations may be needed.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The decision on the type of NEPA compliance document required and the preparation of the NEPA document to accompany the Safety of Dams (SOD) proposals are the responsibility of the region involved. When a safety issue is first identified, solutions should be developed with the use of environmental information, as well as economic and engineering information. If safety concerns require an emergency response action, then emergency NEPA procedures may be applied (40 CFR 1506.11, 43 CFR 46.150; see also section 3.13, Emergency Action, in chapter 3). If it is not an emergency, however, development of solutions should fully integrate environmental concerns into the decisionmaking process regardless of the level of NEPA documentation required. ESA and CWA (Section 404) compliance, for example, must be fully considered.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Care should be taken in developing the purpose and need statement and alternatives for the SOD NEPA document. The purpose and need is usually to correct some safety deficiency at the facility and prevent the loss of life and property that could occur from possible dam failure. At times, Reclamation has received comments from other agencies and parties requesting that it include alternatives that go beyond remedying the safety problems at a facility and address issues such as fish passage as part of dam reconstruction. Any alternatives that would address conditions not associated with the safety concern would not meet the purpose and need for the action. Moreover the Safety of Dams Act authorizes only those Reclamation construction actions needed for dam safety purposes and to maintain existing authorized project purposes.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The procedures for funding SOD activities may appear to force the preparation of a NEPA document before the final details are known. The location or alignment of borrow sites or haul roads, for example, may not be known when funding requests need to go forward. This situation should be avoided; but when it cannot, it is best to include a wide range of components for all the reasonable alternatives. The final selection is then more likely to have been addressed without the need to supplement the NEPA document. Supplementation may be required, however, and this should be considered in scheduling.

However, such activities will be evaluated by use of a CEC to ensure that there are no extraordinary circumstances that would disqualify it from a CE. If extraordinary circumstances exist, an EA should be prepared, and either a FONSI or EIS will be completed.

An examination of the O&amp;M agreement and an exact understanding of the action being considered may be necessary to determine the extent of Federal involvement and the need for NEPA compliance documents. The appropriate Solicitor&rsquo;s Office may be included in this determination. Generally, if Reclamation must approve the O&amp;M action, NEPA applies. Delegated O&amp;M activities would have to go through the same evaluation process described above to determine what level of NEPA is required.

A CE would generally be appropriate only if there is no change in land use and the action is only administrative. If the action is not administrative only and/or there is a change in land use, then an EA or EIS will likely be needed. Note that under the regulations implementing NHPA, the transfer, lease, or sale of a historic property out of Federal control, without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure the long-term preservation of the property&rsquo;s historic significance, constitutes an adverse effect (36 CFR 800.5 (a) (2) (vii)). Be aware that for land acquisitions or disposals, Interior requires bureaus to conduct a pre-acquisition/disposal environmental site assessment to determine the potential for, and extent of, liability for hazardous substances or environmental remediation for hazardous substances on the lands to be acquired or disposed of. This assessment may be incorporated into the NEPA analysis. The outcome will determine whether Reclamation may go ahead with the acquisition (see 602 DM 2). For all exchanges, acquisitions, withdrawals, and disposals, other statutes, (such as NHPA, ESA, etc.) may require analyses beyond the NEPA compliance requirement.

This information is combined with available pest control methods (mechanical, chemical, cultural, and biological).
		</span>
	</p>

			IPM is not a single method of pest control but a combination of management decisions, evaluations, and controls. It usually involves four approaches: (1) setting action thresholds (the point at which pests or the environmental conditions indicate action must be taken), (2) identification of the pests and monitoring, (3) prevention, and (4) control. Less environmentally damaging methods are used first. Only if these methods are unlikely to work are additional, more invasive control methods employed. These approaches are usually described in an IPM plan that is prepared for a project or an area office.

A CEC should be completed to determine if a proposed pesticide research activity qualifies as a CE. Many offices elect to do an EA when an IPM plan is prepared.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Contracting is a dynamic process, and the stages discussed herein may reoccur many times and at any point in the process, as may be dictated by new information. Water-related contracts may be for new or additional water supplies, and amendments to or renewals of existing contracts. Negotiations do not become final until the contract is executed. The Federal action triggering NEPA compliance is contract execution.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Contracts define the respective rights, obligations, privileges, and duties of the United States and the contractor in constructing, financing, operating, and maintaining projects. No government agency or individual can contract on behalf of the United States without specific authority from Congress. Congress has authorized the Secretary to carry out the provisions of Reclamation law and to redelegate this authority to the Commissioner or other officers within Reclamation. Contracting authority for smaller amounts of water and shorter terms has been delegated to Regional Directors. Authority to negotiate and execute contracts for larger amounts of water or longer terms can be delegated to Regional Directors following the Commissioner&rsquo;s approval of a &ldquo;basis of negotiation&rdquo; (BON). The BON request is a request for approval to negotiate and execute a contract. The Commissioner&rsquo;s response, referred to as the &ldquo;approval&rdquo; memorandum, delegates the contracting authority and provides the negotiating parameters for the contract.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The contracting process may begin with a request from a water user for a contract. At this stage, basic information is collected on the practical, operational, environmental, legal, policy, and political considerations. These categories include such issues as Reclamation&rsquo;s authority to provide the water, the water users&rsquo; authority to contract, the availability of water, cost of water, updating of the contract&rsquo;s terms (if the contract is being considered for renewal), NEPA, ESA, and other environmental considerations, as well as potential impacts to third parties (i.e., Indian tribes). If a contract appears feasible, technical discussions are held with the water user and other interested parties to gain a broader understanding of the water users&rsquo; needs and the potential impacts to other water users. The technical discussions are also used to research alternatives to better meet the concerns of all parties having a stake in the contract action. These discussions do not commit Reclamation to any plan or alternative. Following the data collections and technical discussions, the BON is prepared and submitted by the Regional Director to the Commissioner for approval. The BON summarizes the basic information gathered and technical discussions, and recommends a negotiating strategy. Although most basic data have been collected by the time the BON is developed, certain activities such as NEPA and ESA compliance, while they may be ongoing, may not be completed until a definitive project description (i.e., draft contract) is developed. In these instances, the BON will discuss the status of those activities and note that execution of the contract will be dependent upon the completion and results of those studies. Prior to the Commissioner&rsquo;s signature, the memorandum is reviewed for legal sufficiency by the Office of the Solicitor in Washington, DC.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Following the Commissioner&rsquo;s approval memorandum, the Regional Director negotiates the contract. The time to negotiate a contract can vary greatly depending on a variety of circumstances. Typically, once agreement is reached on a contract, there follows a 60-day public review period, after which the contract is executed by the water user and the Regional Director.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			At the very beginning of the contracting process, even before preparation of a BON, Reclamation should engage the NEPA process and include the consideration of environmental factors into development of a BON. This could be in the form of discussions, some type of report or analysis addressing environmental considerations, or a preliminary draft EA identifying the possible contracting alternatives and related environmental impacts. The BON should include a general summary of potential environmental issues.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			To be effective in providing information to the negotiators, NEPA documentation and related environmental information should be developed before a final decision is framed. Having the environmental information available early reduces the risk that the NEPA process will uncover some impacts that require renegotiation of the agreement. The actual NEPA documentation should be initiated before the beginning of the negotiation process and should be framed by the positions of the negotiating parties and the no action alternative. As negotiations progress

		<span class="c1 c23">,</span>
		<span class="c1">
			additional alternatives can be included. The draft NEPA document released for public review should include a preferred alternative.

		<span class="c1 c23">,</span>
		<span class="c1">
			the no action alternative simply represents conditions as they would be with no contract. For renewal of water-related contracts, no action means continuing the existing contract with minor changes to satisfy current legal and contractual requirements. This definition of no action stems from CEQ findings and recommendations on a contract renewal action published in the FR on July 6, 1989. The analysis should describe differences in environmental effects between continuing the existing contract for the proposed contract period compared to the effects of other reasonable alternatives (which may include different contract terms). A renewed contract may implement only administrative/financial changes to an existing contract with no identifiable environmental effects. Reclamation has a CE for these types of actions (516 DM 14.5 (D) (14)), and a CEC would have to be completed to ensure that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would necessitate preparation of an EA or EIS.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">

			Warren Act contracts are generally agreements entered into to allow the storage or conveyance of nonproject water in Reclamation facilities. These contracts are entered into at times when Reclamation has excess conveyance or storage capacity in its facilities. Briefly, Reclamation must determine the direct and indirect impacts of entering into a Warren Act contract and then complete the appropriate level of NEPA compliance. As with other actions associated with the use or transfer of water, care must be taken to clearly define Reclamation&rsquo;s action and those impacts that may result from the Federal action.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation&rsquo;s policy is to make excess capacity available for storage and conveyance of nonproject water only after considering whether and how adverse effects can be avoided or mitigated. Mitigation will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and costs are to be borne by parties other than Reclamation (i.e., the party requesting a contract for the use of excess capacity or others, but not a project contractor or O&amp;M contractor unless they voluntarily agree to do it).

			Scoping of issues and potential alternatives should occur during the development of the BON to provide Reclamation with a broad public review of the issues associated with the existing contract and to provide options for consideration in the development of the BON. Additionally, public involvement can help define the appropriate level of NEPA documentation for the contracting effort. It is expected that an EA is appropriate in many situations, but EISs and CEs may be more appropriate in some situations. This determination should be made as early in the process as possible to allow a reasonable amount of time for the level of documentation that is appropriate.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The preparation of the NEPA document should be initiated as soon as the appropriate level of documentation needed is defined. If possible, it would be most beneficial to provide a preliminary understanding of the environmental consequences in the BON for the Commissioner&rsquo;s consideration. If this is an EA or an EIS, it is helpful to have the draft available at, or shortly after, the start of negotiations. This allows Reclamation, the water users, and the public to understand the environmental consequences (or lack of them) for the issues being negotiated. This should, in turn, encourage the negotiation of provisions that avoid significant environmental impacts, fulfilling the intent of NEPA.

		<span id="bookmark87" class="c5 c1">4.13 Changing Water Use</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The concept of a change in water use has a variety of meanings. Water use changes happen when the application of water is moved from one: (1) location to another, (2) entity to another, or (3) purpose (irrigation) to another purpose (municipal and industrial (M&amp;I)) or multiple purposes (flood control and M&amp;I). It can also occur when the quantity of water applied at a specific location is changed. Changing water use may be accomplished by the assignment of contract entitlements, new water service and repayment contracts, subcontracts, or other arrangements as may be provided by law. Regardless of the type of water use change or mechanism for accomplishing the change, Reclamation and other Federal and State law must be followed before the change can occur. Generally, when Reclamation facilities or water rights are involved, Reclamation&rsquo;s approval must be obtained. An exception may occur when water within a contractor&rsquo;s service area is transferred from one user to another, depending upon individual project circumstances.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Since the 1960s, many Reclamation projects have seen significant changes in water use. These changes are the result of the continued trends of greater irrigation efficiencies, retirement of agricultural lands, and increased urbanization. Other water users such as Indian tribes and fish and wildlife have increasingly been recognized as having equal or prior rights to water. Reclamation&rsquo;s policy is to encourage and facilitate the most efficient beneficial use of water when: (1) such change can be accomplished in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws, and (2) it can be accomplished without diminution of service to those parties otherwise being served by such Federal resources.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A NEPA review is required to identify the likely environmental consequences of a change in water use. The information gathered during the NEPA review, such as the potential impacts to an endangered species, must be considered in Reclamation&rsquo;s decision in approving the water use change. Environmental impacts are considered for both the immediate and long-term effects of a water use change. Some of the questions that are asked to determine the immediate and long-term effects are:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="75">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c1">
				What is the relationship of water supply and urban population growth?
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c1">
				Is the change growth inducing, or are we simply accommodating already existing demographic trends by providing a relatively impact-free source of water?
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c24">
			<span class="c1">
				How far, and to what degree, do we follow the impacts that are associated with the newly approved water use?
			</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation may use a CEC if the proposed water use change qualifies for exclusion. Examples of Reclamation CEs that may apply include:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="78">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c1">
				Approval, execution, and implementation of water-related contracts for minor amounts of long-term water use or temporary or interim water use where the action does not lead to long-term changes and where the impacts are expected to be localized (516 DM 14.5 (D) (4)).
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c1">
				Approval, renewal, transfer, and execution of an original, amendatory, or supplemental water service or repayment contract where the only result will be to implement an administrative or financial practice or change (516 DM 14.5 (D) (14)). An example would be an acquisition of one water company by another, where the project water contract is transferred to the new company, which then provides water to the same service area.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c24">
			<span class="c1">
				Approval of second party water sales agreement for small amounts of water (usually less than 10 acre-feet) where Reclamation has an existing water sales contract in effect (516 DM 14.5 (D) (15)).

	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The complete list of CEs is found in 516 DM 14.5. In those situations where a CE does not apply, or when all questions on a CEC cannot be checked no, an EA or EIS will be required.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			During any NEPA compliance activity, Reclamation should avoid encroaching on State and local governments&rsquo; jurisdiction over local planning, zoning, and other issues associated with &ldquo;growth.&rdquo; This cannot, however, interfere with Reclamation&rsquo;s legal responsibilities under NEPA. It should be recognized that there may be occasions when a Reclamation action may be associated with urban growth.

			(541 U.S. 752 (2004)). In this case, the Federal agency discretion over a potential impact (more truck traffic and more air pollution) was limited, and the Court ruled that the NEPA document did not have to address that potential impact as an effect of the action. Similarly, when Reclamation is involved in a water contracting action, our discretionary control over local growth issues may be very limited.

			Title transfer involves transferring title to Reclamation facilities to another entity. The Framework for the Transfer of Title, August 1995, describes Reclamation&rsquo;s title transfer process and addresses policy and criteria for transferring uncomplicated projects (i.e., those without outstanding environmental or other issues).

			). Issues and obligations that may come up as part of title transfer include: endangered and threatened species concerns, cultural resources issues, hazardous materials concerns, treaties and compacts (international/Indian and interstate), ITAs, and compliance with a variety of EOs (e.g., wetlands, flood plains, pollution prevention, environmental justice, and others). Note that under the regulations implementing the NHPA, the transfer, lease, or sale of a historic property out of Federal control, without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure the long-term preservation of the property&rsquo;s historic significance, constitutes an adverse effect (36 CFR 800.5 (a) (2) (vii)). It is very important to address cultural resources, as well as issues under other laws and obligations (e.g., ESA, ITA) at the outset of any discussions on potential title transfers. Compliance with certain statutes and Federal responsibilities may trigger a series of consultation and analytical steps that could delay completion of the NEPA process and possibly terminate title transfer.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			As in any other environmental review, staff will have to review the proposal and determine if compliance with other environmental laws is an issue.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The title transfer process includes a public involvement component. One means of identifying potential environmental problems and controversial issues is to notify stakeholders and interested parties and get them involved early in discussions on title transfer.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			If mitigation of potential environmental impacts is appropriate, or if there are prior environmental commitments associated with the project, it is Reclamation&rsquo;s recommendation that these should be fully implemented before title is transferred,

		<span id="bookmark89" class="c5 c1">4.15 Financial Assistance Programs</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation provides financial assistance through several different types of business instruments. These are used to convey funds to other entities through: (1) cost-share programs such as Title XVI and Title 28, Water SMART grants, and other partnership activities; (2) cost reimbursement for programs such as drought relief assistance; and (3) funding of activities such as FWCA reports.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Appropriate NEPA compliance will depend upon the specific action being considered. When Reclamation has no control and responsibility over the expenditure of funds provided, NEPA compliance is not required (43 CFR 46.100(a)). This generally occurs when an Act of Congress specifically directs Reclamation to provide funding for a particular activity or to a particular entity. It should be noted that Federal funding under these circumstances may still require consideration under other requirements (e.g., NHPA section 106).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			When some degree of control and responsibility exists, NEPA compliance is appropriate. Signing of financial assistance documents, payments of associated costs, and transfers of money are contingent upon first completing appropriate environmental compliance.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Generally, studies and planning assistance activities are categorically excluded from NEPA compliance by Interior and do not require completion of a CEC. In addition, if these activities are restricted to such actions as nondestructive data collection, monitoring, and nonmanipulative field studies, they may not require analysis under other environmental laws and regulations. However, cultural clearances and Section 404 permits may be required for monitoring or studies involving ground disturbing actions such as test pits or drill holes and, therefore, a CEC should be completed. In general, if the action being approved or funded is not expected to cause on-the-ground effects, it is probably not necessary to complete a CEC.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Under NEPA, an appropriate document must be prepared which describes and analyzes the environmental effects of a proposed Federal action, including non-Federal actions funded by Reclamation. Preparation of a CEC may be appropriate for most financial assistance proposals. However, proposals with unclear or potentially significant impacts will require preparation of an EA or an EIS. For these latter two documents, sufficient time and funds must be allowed for completion before the assistance document can be signed (i.e., the document which approves the proposed action and commits funds to implement that action).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In addition, NEPA compliance for projects of non-Federal partners on Reclamation lands, regardless of the funding source (cost share or otherwise), is generally required. For example, NEPA compliance is required prior to construction of new facilities in a recreational area managed by a county for Reclamation, even if the county and/or other entities are paying the total cost.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			It should be noted that non-Federal entities are not &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for compliance with NEPA. NEPA compliance is Reclamation&rsquo;s responsibility. However, due to policy, budget, and staffing limitations, Reclamation often requires that benefiting entities (proponents) provide the needed information and even, in some cases, the analysis necessary for the NEPA compliance documentation (40 CFR 1506.5(a)). In the case of interagency acquisitions, the appropriate Federal partner may be required to complete the NEPA analysis and documentation. This requirement should be specified in the financial agreement.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">

			Inclusions and exclusions occur when land is being added to an existing service area (inclusion) or when land is being removed from an existing Reclamation project area (exclusion). Inclusions and exclusions should be viewed as any other action undertaken by Reclamation and, as such, are to be reviewed pursuant to NEPA. There is often some land-use change that is caused by these activities, and such a change must be evaluated as part of the action in evaluating an inclusion or exclusion. When the inclusion/exclusion may result in land use changes impacting the environment, an EA or an EIS (if warranted) may be appropriate. In cases in which it can be established that Reclamation&rsquo;s action of approving inclusions/exclusions has no demonstrable effect on land use (and, thus, no environmental effects), a CEC is likely the appropriate document.

			Applicants are private or other non-Federal entities that initiate or propose actions which, at some stage of planning and development, need Reclamation approval or assistance through the submission of applications. It is a requirement of Interior NEPA regulations (43 CFR 46.200(e)) that the applicants be informed, as soon as it is practicable, of any responsibility they will bear for funding environmental analysis. Reclamation should always inform applicants of environmental information that must be included in their application and any consultations the applicant must complete before or during the application process. In practical terms, this means Reclamation EAs, and even EISs, will frequently be drafted by consulting firms paid by the applicants. For such externally driven proposals, NEPA compliance questions commonly arise in three areas: (1) range of alternatives, (2) limitations on actions by the applicant, and (3) contractor selection requirements. As noted earlier, Reclamation remains fully responsible for the adequacy of NEPA compliance.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Frequently, the applicant&rsquo;s proposed action will be submitted to Reclamation for approval, and the Federal decision (action) may be to simply approve or disapprove. In such situations, Reclamation must determine what other alternatives should be considered in the NEPA document and whether these alternatives are &ldquo;reasonable,&rdquo; given the purpose and need of the action.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">

			In later guidance (August 1983 guidance memorandum), CEQ concludes it is reasonable for the Federal agency to limit the range of alternatives to those &ldquo;. . . which are considered feasible, given the applicant&rsquo;s stated goals.&rdquo; The agency should consider the &ldquo;applicant&rsquo;s purposes and needs and the common sense realities of a given situation in the development of alternatives.&rdquo;
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The determination of appropriate alternatives is a Reclamation responsibility. The responsible official has discretion to determine what (if any) action alternatives are appropriate.

			The applicant is clearly held to the same standard as the Federal agency in taking action prior to completion of the NEPA process. That is, the applicant should not take any action prior to the ROD or FONSI that would have an adverse environmental impact or that would limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. The difficulty for the Federal agency lies in how to enforce this limitation when the applicant may be initiating the proposal with its own money and on its own property (i.e., there is no Federal authority to stop such private actions). CEQ advises the Federal agency to &ldquo;notify the applicant that the agency will take strong affirmative steps to ensure that the objectives and procedures of NEPA are fulfilled.&rdquo; For example, the agency might advise an applicant that if it takes such action, the agency will not process its application.

			The above-referenced guidance should be consulted for detailed information, especially the August 10, 1983, CEQ memorandum, regarding contractor-prepared NEPA documents. In general, preliminary EAs may be prepared by applicants (or their consultants, known as &ldquo;third party contracts&rdquo;) without prior approval or involvement by the Federal agency in the selection of the consultant. Early coordination, however, is encouraged. The Federal agency may accept such EAs if they meet the agency&rsquo;s requirements, including compliance with CEQ regulations. Ultimately, Reclamation is responsible for the scope and content of the EA; consequently, Reclamation must independently review and evaluate the information in the EA to ensure that it meets Reclamation&rsquo;s requirements.

			There are situations in which a consulting firm may be hired under a &ldquo;third party contract.&rdquo; According to CEQ&rsquo;s Forty Most Asked Questions, a third party contract refers to the preparation of EISs by contractors paid by the applicant, not by the agency. In these cases, the lead or cooperating agency must select the contractor, even though the contract is between the consulting firm and the applicant. The applicant would prepare the paperwork for soliciting contractor candidates, and Federal acquisition requirements would not apply because the Federal agency procures nothing and incurs no obligations or costs under the contract. CEQ guidance and regulations, cited above, should be carefully reviewed.

		<span class="c1">
			An environmental management system (EMS) is a management practice that allows an organization to manage its controllable environmental impacts in a systematic way. EMS implementation in Reclamation reflects the International Organization for Standardization 14001:2004(E) model. This model embraces a Plan/Do/Check/Act management cycle where the organization&rsquo;s environmental impacts are identified, goals and targets related to significant impacts are set, progress is monitored, and adjustments are made in the context of management review to foster continual performance improvement.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			EMS differs from NEPA in that the EMS typically requires identification of environmental aspects associated with an organization&rsquo;s ongoing operations and activities, prioritizing those which have, or can have, significant impacts on the environment. EMS provides a framework to improve day-to-day environmental performance, including the achievement of environmental regulatory compliance, not just &ldquo;major Federal actions.&rdquo; EMS also requires continuous review, adjustments, and improvement to reduce environmental impacts year after year. NEPA and EMS are distinct and separate processes at different phases of project planning and operation. However, the results of the NEPA process can be utilized in EMS to identify and prioritize environmental aspects of a proposed activity or of similar ongoing activities.

			As explained in chapter 3, a CE applies to actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Each CE is approved by CEQ and excludes categories of Federal actions from further NEPA documentation because those types of actions have been shown to have no significant effect on the environment. A CEC is a tool Reclamation uses to document consideration of &ldquo;extraordinary circumstances&rdquo; (43 CFR 46.215) in the application of a CE to a particular situation.

		<span class="c1">
			As a general rule, preparation of a CEC should be a fairly rapid process, taking a few hours or a few days and involving a little research, a few coordination telephone calls, and/or short face-to-face discussions to get information, as needed, to fill out the checklist. Some internal and external scoping of issues and documentation may also be required. If completion of the CEC is going to take weeks and/or months to scope and document, or if the answer to any question is uncertain or &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; an EA should generally be prepared.

		<span class="c1">
			The use of a CE depends upon three basic criteria. First, the action being considered must fit into one of the categories on the list of CEs. Second, the responsible official must believe that there are no potential significant impacts or complications that would make a CE inappropriate; and, third, no extraordinary circumstances apply.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Interior (43 CFR 46.210) has a list of CEs that can be used for any agency&rsquo;s actions. Additionally, there is a Reclamation-specific list (516 DM 14.5) that can also apply (

		</span>
		<span class="c1">
			NEPA compliance for proposed actions that do not fit into any of the categories on these lists, even if there are believed to be no potentially significant effects, should start with an EA. Also, any time a proposed action has any potentially significant complications (such as site-specific circumstances of concern), an EA should be prepared instead. Finally, a CEC should be prepared whenever a Reclamation CE is used (and may be advisable even when using an Interior CE in unique circumstances).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">

			Any action that is normally categorically excluded must be subjected to sufficient environmental review to determine whether any extraordinary circumstances (43 CFR 46.215) apply.

		<span class="c1">
			The CEC should be used to evaluate an individual action in relation to the impacts it may cause. Figure 5.1 is an example of the minimum contents of a CEC. The format for a CEC may change between regions, but the wording of the evaluation criteria reflects the language of 43 CFR 46.215, the requirements of several Executive orders, and Reclamation policy on ITAs and, therefore, should not be changed. If all the answers to the checklist are &ldquo;no,&rdquo; the action meets the criteria for a CE.

			If, after reasonable efforts to clear up uncertainties and compliance questions, an answer is checked &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; an EA should be prepared. If it is certain the impacts are potentially significant (40 CFR 1508.27), the EA process may be bypassed, and the preparation of an EIS initiated. If answers are uncertain, an EA may be necessary and additional information gathered to relieve the uncertainty. If project mitigation is required, the action probably should be covered by an EA rather than a CE. Even so, environmental commitments may be made which, when followed, would eliminate the need for specific mitigation measures. These commitments (which would be documented in the CEC) include such measures as stopping work and calling in a cultural resource specialist if archeological resources were uncovered in the course of the action, or consulting with the Service if unexpected evidence of a T&amp;E species were found on the site. These commitments are not an attempt to produce a &ldquo;mitigated CE&rdquo; but, rather, an acknowledgment that unexpected things can happen and that Reclamation will respond appropriately if something should occur.

Identification of ITAs should involve consultation and/or coordination with potentially affected Indian tribes, individuals, or entities; BIA; the Solicitor&rsquo;s Office; and/or the area and regional Native American Affairs coordinator. As the determination of ITA status is essentially a legal issue, the involvement of the Solicitor&rsquo;s Office is important when it is essential to state with certainty whether something is an ITA. All impacts to ITAs, even nonsignificant ones, must be considered. Adverse impacts should be avoided when possible and mitigated or compensated when not avoidable.

			The EA is a concise public document used to determine whether to prepare a FONSI or EIS. Because CEQ defines the term &ldquo;environmental assessment&rdquo; as the basis for either a FONSI or an EIS, this term should not be used for other Reclamation documents.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">

		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			EAs should be written for actions for which there is not an appropriate CE, or for actions that may fall under an exclusion category but do not qualify under the checklist criteria. These types of EAs may be fairly short if the action is minor with no controversy (disputes over scientific conclusions or impacts of the action).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The average EA should be about 30 pages or less. As the length of the EA increases, the chances increase that an EIS is the correct documentation under NEPA, simply because the number of issues is one indication of the possibility of significant impacts.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			An EA may also be prepared when minor changes are made to a proposed action for which an EIS has been completed. As an example, this type of EA may be prepared when a programmatic EIS has been completed but site-specific layout and design of projects have not taken place. Another example occurs when an EIS was done for development of an irrigation district but changes to the delivery system are proposed. This situation is specifically addressed in Interior&rsquo;s regulations at 43 CFR 46.140 (c). Reclamation does not recommend the use of
		</span>
		<span class="c0 c1">
			the term &ldquo;finding of no new significant impact&rdquo; to conclude these assessments.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			EAs are generally prepared in the regions by either the area or regional offices, and the head of the area or regional office has ultimate responsibility for their adequacy. The TSC may prepare an EA for a region or may (rarely) prepare one for a TSC internal action (e.g., research actions). An environmental specialist with expertise in NEPA should be involved in the preparation and review of all EAs.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In addition, an EA may be used to evaluate any action at any time to assist in planning and decisionmaking. This information would not necessarily lead to a decision to prepare an EIS, but it would provide the decisionmaker with information on environmental issues and effects that may be incorporated upfront in a proposal. Public notification is not required for such an analysis but should be included where appropriate.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Finally, for EAs that are likely to be complex or to address a wide range of issues, a review of EIS actions and content (chapters 7 and 8) is recommended.

		<span id="bookmark108" class="c5 c1">6.2 Actions Associated with an EA</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The EA process is less formal than the EIS process. For a minor, routine action, an EA may simply be a short document written by a few people within a Reclamation office and approved with a simple public Notice of Availability (NOA) but without any formal public review process. However, there should still be consultation with various agencies and affected interests, including Indian tribes. Information should be provided to the public on the NEPA process and how to get involved. An EA on a complex action with substantial public interest may involve many of the public involvement actions, and other actions, associated with an EIS. Depending on the complexity of the proposal, the following actions may be appropriate:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="90">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c1">

		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			No formal public scoping is required for an EA; however, informal scoping, which may be internal to Reclamation, is needed to define the potentially significant issues and the scope of analysis. Such informal scoping should always involve appropriate disciplines within Reclamation and may involve other agencies or interested parties, depending upon the complexity of, and issues raised by, the proposed action. Where the proposed action is likely to be controversial, or one that usually requires an EIS, formal public scoping meetings should be considered. The extent of public scoping and involvement is at the discretion of the lead office and should reflect potential issues and controversy. All potentially significant issues identified must be analyzed in the EA.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation is responsible for the adequacy, completeness, and processing of all EAs involving Reclamation actions, projects, and lands. Proponents for actions requiring Reclamation&rsquo;s approval will normally have to supply the appropriate information needed for any required NEPA document. If a contractor will be developing an environmental report for the proponent to use to comply with NEPA requirements, Reclamation should participate in the selection of the contractor. In addition, the report must meet Reclamation standards. Further, the contractor should provide a disclosure statement specifying that they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the proposed project. The applicant may bear the costs of gathering environmental information necessary for NEPA compliance or the costs may be shared, depending upon the proposed action and applicable authorities. The applicant may do this by hiring a contractor to obtain the necessary information or by providing funds to Reclamation to do the work (also see section 4.19).

		<span class="c1">
			The EA should be started as early as possible following definition of the proposed action and be developed concurrently with other studies. The office proposing an action must schedule sufficient time for the EA to be prepared and obtain sufficient budget for its completion. The time needed for the EA process is highly variable, depending upon the issues and controversy associated with the proposal and the extent of public review and interest. At any time during the preparation of an EA, issues may be identified that indicate the need for an EIS. If the schedule does not allow for such an event, a significant disruption of the schedule could occur.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In addition, the timeframe can be significantly affected by the separate processes associated with NHPA compliance, FWCA requirements, ITA analysis, consultation under the ESA, and others. These factors should be taken into consideration when developing a timeline.

The following information is optional but may be helpful in more fully defining the need: Federal permits, licenses, approvals, and entitlements that will be necessary to implement the project, and ongoing actions that may affect or be affected by the proposed project.

			The need for appropriate and reasonable alternatives is dependent upon (among other considerations) there being no unresolved conflicts about the proposed action with respect to alternative uses of available resources. If none exist, no alternatives need be considered or analyzed. Unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of resources are undefined in law or regulation and are to be determined by the responsible official. Considerations include, but are not limited to, the degree of public interest, other priorities, and the potential for environmental effects. If no alternatives are included, this section should present the reasons for that. If alternatives are included, this section should describe all alternatives at a brief, focused, and comparable level of detail.

		<span class="c1">
			While a &ldquo;no action alternative&rdquo; is not required in an EA under CEQ or Interior regulations, it is Reclamation&rsquo;s practice to include it because it provides an appropriate basis by which all other alternatives are compared. In the (not recommended) event that an EA does not contain a no action alternative, the effects should be determined by comparing the impacts of the action alternative(s) to existing conditions. The no action alternative should be presented first so that the reader can easily compare the other alternatives to it. Conditions under the no action alternative should not be considered identical to existing conditions of the affected environment because future actions may occur regardless of whether any of the action alternatives are chosen. These future actions could include other water development projects, land use changes, or municipal development. The no action alternative is therefore often described as &ldquo;the future without the Federal project.&rdquo; If other projects in the affected area are likely to occur and the effects are reasonably foreseeable, it should be discussed in the no action alternative. Sufficient discussion should be presented so that readers can make the needed comparisons for the evaluation and understand how the no action alternative is different from existing conditions.

		<span class="c1 c38 c23">6.4.2.2 Action Alternatives</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Action alternatives include the proposed action and all other feasible and reasonable alternatives that will be evaluated in the EA. Each action alternative should fulfill the requirements of the need for the project as described in the &ldquo;Need&rdquo; section of the assessment. Alternatives should be based upon needs and relevant issues. The appropriate analysis should be presented for each alternative so that reviewers may evaluate the environmental impacts of each alternative by comparing them to the no action alternative. This analysis should be at a comparable level of detail for all alternatives. These discussions should be brief and tightly focused upon potentially significant issues. An EA does not require the detailed analysis of alternatives presented in an EIS. The proposed action should be identified in the assessment to make readers aware of the action that is being contemplated, allowing them to focus their review on that action. It is possible that only the no action alternative and the proposed action alternatives need to be analyzed if no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of resources exist. If there is consensus among community representatives and stakeholders for a consensus-based alternative (43 CFR 46.110), and it is feasible and meets the purpose and need for the action, then it should also be evaluated in the EA.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			There is no requirement to identify a preferred alternative in an EA, although it may be helpful for situations in which a broad range of alternatives is being considered. Similarly, alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study do not need to be addressed in an EA. But, again, if the situation warrants it, such a discussion may be useful for increased public understanding. As the complexity increases in the EA, it may be useful to refer to the chapters on EISs or consider if an EIS is the appropriate NEPA compliance document.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Alternatives outside the agency&rsquo;s authority to implement may be considered, if reasonable. If such an alternative became the preferred alternative, implementation would depend on a change in authorization, a change of the lead Federal agency to one with the appropriate authority, or a transfer of the project to a non-Federal entity. It could also lead to the cancellation of the project.

A brief discussion of critical environmental issues&mdash;such as ITAs, Indian sacred sites, environmental justice, cultural resources, and T&amp;E species&mdash;is necessary to show that they have been considered, even if there are no impacts or only minor impacts. Where ongoing activities have effects in these areas, the discussion should summarize both the context and intensity of the ongoing effect and what specific ongoing activity is causing the effect.

		<span class="c1">
			The &ldquo;Environmental Consequences&rdquo; chapter forms the scientific and analytic basis for the comparison of alternatives, including the proposed action and no action. In this section, the environmental impacts of all action alternatives will be discussed and compared to the no action alternative. The analysis should present facts and information but avoid conclusions regarding significance&mdash;that is the function of the FONSI. It is important that analyses are presented in a clear, concise discussion, and only for meaningful project impacts. If the project would have no impact in critical environmental areas or on such issues as those involving wetlands and endangered species, this should also be stated. Note that all impacts to ITAs, sacred sites, and environmental justice need to be considered and addressed, whether minor or potentially significant, in accordance with Reclamation&rsquo;s ITA policy, procedures, and guidance (also see ECM 97-2 and 95-3 at

			The analysis of impacts should focus on those resources that may be affected in a significant way by the proposal. It is suggested that a CEC be used to provide a preliminary scope of the issues to be addressed in this analysis. Other resources may need to be examined as well, depending upon the site-specific nature of the proposal.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Potential beneficial and adverse impacts should be presented. The EA should address short- and long-term impacts, direct and indirect impacts, irreversible and irretrievable resource commitments, and residual or net (those remaining after all mitigation measures are implemented) impacts. If appropriate, the EA should also discuss potential cumulative impacts resulting from actions taken by Reclamation, other Federal agencies, and State and local agencies, and how they relate to the action being considered. (For further information on direct, indirect, residual, and cumulative impacts, see chapter 8.)

			Although the EA ordinarily should not exceed about 30 single-spaced pages in length, a proposal of great complexity may require additional description and analysis. As an EA increases in length and complexity, increased consideration should be given to preparing an EIS, rather than an EA, as the appropriate NEPA compliance document. The document should be written in a clear, concise fashion based on the necessary environmental analysis and kept as brief as possible, using referenced and incorporated material as practicable. Every attempt should be made to avoid overly technical language. The text, appropriate tables, and figures should be presented so the decisionmakers and the public can readily understand them.

		<span id="bookmark120" class="c5 c1">6.6 Review and Distribution of an EA</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			No formal public review of an EA is required&mdash;only public notice. However, public review is commonly included in the process and is often helpful (40 CFR 1506.6, 40 CFR 1501.4(e), and 43 CFR 46.305). Public involvement for an EA can be a simple public notice or posting to Reclamation&rsquo;s Web site that an EA is available, without preparation or distribution of a draft EA, for simple, noncontroversial proposals, or it can be more extensive. On occasion, the review can be similar to an EIS in terms of public involvement, including scoping meetings, publication of a draft EA, public meetings on the draft EA, and formal responses to comments in the final EA (for highly complex, controversial proposals). Again, as complexity, potential significance, and potential controversy (based on the analysis and effects of the proposed action rather than merely whether a group or individual likes the project) increase, the need to consider an EIS as the appropriate NEPA compliance document also increases.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			When a draft EA is being prepared, preliminary review of the draft EA by any cooperating entities, such as project sponsors, the Service, EPA, or Indian tribes, is encouraged. The level of the review and selection of the reviewing entities will be at the discretion of the office preparing the draft EA.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			As appropriate, the draft EA should be made available for comment to potentially affected Indian tribes, affected ITA trustees and beneficiaries, State and local agencies or organizations, and local offices of Federal agencies with expertise in the field. Obtaining assistance through consultation is encouraged before the EA is written. Holding public meetings on the proposed action may be desirable but is not required. The critical factor is to ensure that all interested parties are notified, regardless of the mechanism used.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Any public review of an EA may also fulfill the public review requirements related to NHPA, EO 11990, EO 11988, and ITAs.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Public notice that an EA is available is required by 40 CFR 1506.6(b) (see also question 38 in CEQ&rsquo;s NEPA&rsquo;s Forty Most Asked Questions). A public notice can be as informal as a press release or as formal as a FR notice, depending upon the specific situation.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			If a FONSI is contemplated, it is permissible to state this preliminary decision in any published draft EA, and even to include a draft FONSI with the draft EA. In this circumstance, the cover letter, or the text of the EA, should make it clear that no final decision on a FONSI will be made until the public review is completed and comments are considered.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In limited cases, where the proposed action is similar to one that normally requires an EIS (listed in DM Part 516, chapter 14), or where the nature of the action is without precedent, the FONSI must be made available for public review for 30 days before a final decision is made on whether or not to prepare an EIS. When this 30-day public review of a FONSI is required, it is expected that the EA will also be available for a 30-day public review. These reviews can be, and usually are, simultaneous.

		<span class="c1">
			If, based on the EA, the responsible official decides that the impacts of the proposed action are not significant and do not warrant preparation of an EIS, a FONSI will be prepared by the originating office. The FONSI will generally be short and should be no longer than necessary to address the impacts identified in the EA and any other required subjects (e.g., ITAs, sacred sites, etc.). Examples of FONSIs are shown in figures 6.2 and 6.3.

		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The absence of controversy over a proposed action does not necessarily indicate that a FONSI is appropriate any more than the presence of controversy means an EIS is required.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The FONSI is an agency finding supported by the evaluation of impacts in the EA. The EA will be attached to the FONSI. The FONSI shall note any other environmental documents related to the action. Such documents may be EAs/EISs that are completed or being prepared. These documents may be related to, but are not part of, the scope of the proposal under consideration.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The FONSI should explicitly address every impact identified in the EA and present reasons why those impacts are not significant for the preferred alternative. It can be useful to discuss significance in terms of the context and intensity of the impact (40 CFR 1508.27). This would include identifying any mitigation measures that would be adopted to reduce or eliminate impacts, as well as other environmental commitments. A FONSI may be prepared on proposed actions having the potential for significant effects when it can be clearly demonstrated that mitigation which reduces impacts to the point of nonsignificance is proposed as part of the action. (See discussion in CEQs NEPA&rsquo;s Forty Most Asked Questions, No. 40 and CEQ&rsquo;s January 14, 2011, memorandum, &ldquo;Appropriate Use of Mitigation and Monitoring and Clarifying the Appropriate Use of Mitigated Findings of No Significant Impact.&rdquo;)
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Mitigation measures and other environmental commitments may be adopted as part of Reclamation&rsquo;s final decision on an action in the same manner as it would be adopted in a ROD. (See discussion in CEQ&rsquo;s NEPA&rsquo;s Forty Most Asked Questions, No. 39.) An Environmental Commitments Plan is recommended to ensure that environmental commitments are appropriately implemented.

			Actions that may affect T&amp;E species require consultation with the Service and/or NOAA-NMFS. Effects on National Register listed or eligible properties require consultation with the SHPO. A Service or NOAA-NMFS biological opinion indicating jeopardy or adverse modification of critical habitat would generally preclude the preparation of a FONSI.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			If Reclamation, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO, determines that a historic property may lose its eligibility for inclusion in the National Register as a result of a proposed action, or if Reclamation and the SHPO/THPO do not agree on mitigation of an adverse effect to a historic property, this situation may preclude preparation of a FONSI. However, a FONSI can always be prepared as long as the proposed action is modified to avoid any potentially significant impacts&mdash;also known as the mitigation FONSI (see also Reclamation Manual Directive and Standard LND 02-01).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The FONSI must include a statement that there will be no impacts to ITAs, or else a statement describing the expected impacts; a listing of unresolved issues; a list of commitments to prevent, mitigate, or compensate adverse impacts to these areas; and a summary of any mitigation, monitoring, and enforcement programs related to these areas (ITA guidance, ECM 97-2, and 512 DM 2).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			With regard to Indian sacred sites, as defined by EO 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites) and 512 DM 3 (Departmental Responsibilities for Protecting/Accommodating Access to Indian Sacred Sites), the FONSI must include a statement that there will be no impacts that would adversely affect the physical integrity of such sites and that access to, or ceremonial use of, such sites would not be restricted, or a statement describing the anticipated effects or restrictions. It should also include information similar to that provided for ITAs, but with regards to the Indian sacred site, including access. If impacts are anticipated, an explanation must also be provided as to why such impacts cannot be avoided in accordance with EO 13007.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">

			The document should include similar information for environmental justice (EO 12898, Environmental Justice).

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The conclusions should be expressed as briefly and concisely as possible and should cover the major issues included in the EA. Topics not covered by analysis in the EA should not be introduced in the FONSI. If significant new environmental information is developed or plans are significantly changed between the time the EA is prepared and the FONSI is scheduled to be signed, the EA should be revised to include the new information before the FONSI is signed. Once the FONSI is signed, new information or a modification to the proposal before the action is completed should trigger a review of the EA/FONSI. This review could result in a determination that no new analysis is needed, a revision of the existing EA/FONSI, a new EA, or (very rarely) an EIS, depending upon the site-specific circumstances.

The availability of the FONSI and assessment shall be announced to the affected public (40 CFR 1506.6(b)). This notice may be accomplished by posting to a Web site, if appropriate.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			If the FONSI covers an action that normally would require an EIS, or is an action without precedent, the FONSI shall be circulated for public review for 30 days with appropriate public notice. The determination to finalize the FONSI or prepare an EIS (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)) and the initiation of the proposed action may not occur until this process is completed. It would normally be expected that the EA would be circulated with the FONSI. Also, any EA/FONSI may be circulated for public review whenever circumstances warrant (such as controversy or to assist a local co-lead in meeting procedural requirements).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			It is recommended that the region or area office, depending upon regional policy, serially number and file each FONSI that is initiated and prepared. Each FONSI prepared during a calendar year may be serially numbered using either the region or area office designation - FONSI - year - number to date (e.g., GP-FONSI-89-1). This will aid in referencing the document, as well as assist in tracking FONSI decisions Reclamation wide.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Because the FONSI will be used as backup documentation for decisionmaking packages in the regional or area office, it is recommended that each region establish a single repository for all EAs and FONSIs produced.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In instances in which another agency has completed an EA and FONSI on the same action, the appropriate regional or area office official may independently analyze the documents and, if applicable, use them as Reclamation&rsquo;s NEPA compliance (see section 3.14, &ldquo;Adoption of Other Documents&rdquo;). In these instances, a Reclamation cover sheet and a separate discussion on the analysis and reasons for adoption should be prepared. It is also appropriate to adopt a proponent-prepared environmental report in the same manner. Adoption does not eliminate the need for any appropriate public review prior to finalizing the EA/FONSI.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The primary purpose of an EIS is to infuse the policies and goals of NEPA into Federal programs and actions. An EIS shall be prepared to inform decisionmakers and the public of the proposed action, reasonable alternatives, and their environmental impacts. It is to be used by Reclamation officials, in conjunction with other relevant material, to plan actions and to make decisions. A flowchart indicating major steps in the NEPA process is found in chapter 3, figure 3.1.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			An EA (as discussed in chapter 6) may sometimes lead to a decision to prepare an EIS; however, there are some general activities for which it is known that there could be significant impacts. For these activities, the need to prepare an EIS is known without first preparing an EA. These activities normally include major actions involving construction of a new water resource project or a major unit of an existing project; proposed modifications to existing projects or actions that could result in changes in the authorized operation of an existing project and new or additional impacts; and new land and water management programs.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span id="bookmark131" class="c5 c1">7.2 Typical EISs</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The most common type of EIS focuses on a site-specific action or project. The next most common EIS type is the programmatic EIS. NEPA requires an EIS to be prepared when potentially significant impacts can result from the establishment of a program or new regulations (a programmatic EIS). A programmatic EIS (40 CFR 1500.4(i), 1502.4(b) and (c), 1502.20) is one that analyzes broad-scope actions that are similar in terms of timing, geography, or other characteristics that provide a basis for evaluating environmental consequences. It provides a generic analysis of impacts that may not attempt to define the site-specific effects in detail but that do present at least a range of effects that reflect the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the program. While site-specific data may not be available, the requirement of NEPA to gather all reasonably available information needed to support a reasoned choice among alternatives does apply to a programmatic EIS. The range of alternatives considered may include various combinations of program elements. Careful screening of alternatives is necessary to keep the analysis manageable.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A programmatic EIS supports broad policy or program decisions that constrain or define specific proposals that may be proposed as part of the program or under the policy. Subsequent analysis of more specific proposals would generally be required under NEPA and would be more specific because it would be of narrower scope. Information from a programmatic EIS can be referenced (&ldquo;tiered&rdquo;) in the subsequent NEPA document to reduce redundancy and address broad cumulative effects.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c7">

			7.2.1 Legislative EIS (40 CFR 1506.8, 1508.17; 43 CFR 46.445)
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Either the site-specific or programmatic EIS can be used to propose legislation. The legislative EIS includes a bill or legislative proposal (including a proposal to reauthorize a project) to Congress, developed by or with the significant cooperation and support of a Federal agency, but it does not include requests for appropriations. The test for &ldquo;significant cooperation&rdquo; is whether the proposal is, in fact, predominantly that of the agency rather than of another source (drafting does not by itself constitute significant cooperation). Only the agency that has primary responsibility for the subject matter involved will prepare a legislative EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			There are two types of legislative EISs. The first type is used for proposals that are not site specific. The legislative EIS is filed with EPA, sent with the legislative proposal to Congress, and is intended to be the detailed statement required by law. In this instance, the legislative EIS will be so marked and will not be identified as a &ldquo;draft&rdquo; or &ldquo;final.&rdquo; This legislative EIS will not be distributed for public review and comment. Reclamation has not prepared this type of EIS recently, if ever.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The second type of legislative EIS is required for proposals for Federal or federally assisted construction or other projects, which the agency recommends to Congress, to be located in a specific geographical area (other categories are detailed in 40 CFR 1506.8). These are essentially routine EISs filed with EPA and sent to Congress as draft legislative EISs no later than 30 days after the legislative proposal is forwarded. A distribution is made for review and comment, a public hearing is held, and a FEIS is prepared and filed. The main advantage of this type of legislative EIS is that the proposal can be sent to Congress for action with only the DEIS. The FEIS is forwarded at a later time. Again, Reclamation has not prepared this type of EIS recently, if ever.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			All of the EISs described in sections 7.2 and 7.2.1 can be delegated or nondelegated, although the vast majority of them are delegated. A delegated EIS is one for which the decision authority on the proposed action rests, by delegation, with a single Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary, in turn, may delegate this responsibility to individual bureaus (see sections 7.8.1.1 and 7.8.1.2 below). Any EIS signed at the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, regional office, or area office level is a delegated EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">

	<ol class="c42" start="129">
		<li class="c6">

				An EIS reserved or elevated to the Secretary (or Office of the Secretary) by expressed interest of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Chief of Staff, Solicitor, or Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget, or

			</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Nondelegated EISs are to be reviewed by OEPC. OEPC should provide clearance, to indicate informal, but substantive, approval of a nondelegated EIS prior to Reclamation printing the document. This approval can be accomplished by OEPC&rsquo;s affirmative response (by any method, including e-mail or a telephone call) to Reclamation&rsquo;s request to OPEC to print.

			7.3 Tiering and Transferred Analyses (40 CFR 1502.20; 43 CFR 46.120, 46.140; 516 DM 1.18)
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Agencies are encouraged to tier their EISs to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review (40 CFR 1508.28).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			&ldquo;Tiering&rdquo; refers to following up on analysis contained in a broader EIS (such as national programs, policy statements, or large geographic areas) with subsequent narrower EISs or EAs (such as regional or basinwide program statements or, ultimately, site-specific statements), incorporating by reference the general discussions and concentrating solely on the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared. Tiering is appropriate when the sequence of statements or analyses is:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="133">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c1">
				From a program, plan, or policy EIS to a program, plan, or policy statement or analysis of lesser scope or to a site-specific statement or analysis.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c24">
			<span class="c1">
				From an EIS on a specific action at an early stage (such as need and site selection) to a supplement (which is preferred) or a subsequent statement or analysis at a later stage (the later stage could address the design and implementation of a project or the proposed modification of a project in response to monitoring and evaluation [adaptive management]). Tiering in such cases is appropriate when it helps the lead agency to focus on the issues which are ripe for decision and to exclude from consideration issues already decided or not yet ripe.
			</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			If tiering is anticipated, the entire process should be outlined at the outset, if known, so that the interested public can understand what level of detail and analysis will be included in each tier.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			When a broad EIS has been prepared, and a subsequent EIS or EA is prepared on a specific action included within the broad program or policy, the subsequent statement need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement. Issues addressed in a broad EIS are incorporated by reference so that the document can concentrate on issues specific to the subsequent or following action. An EA tiered to a broad EIS need only analyze the changes to, or details of, the original proposal not previously analyzed to determine if any of those changes or details result in potentially significant impacts. The subsequent document shall state where the earlier document is available. Preparers must ensure that conditions described in the earlier document are still in effect and that the analysis is reliable. If substantial changes have occurred, the tiered document must include additional documentation, and the analysis must be revised to bring the document up to date. When tiering is anticipated, it is prudent to print a substantial number of extra copies of the document for distribution during review of subsequent documents. For additional information, see ESM 10-17, &ldquo;Procedures for Implementing Tiered and Transference of Analyses.&rdquo;
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			To avoid duplication of effort and reduce paperwork and costs, Reclamation staff are encouraged to utilize environmental information and analyses developed in previous environmental documents when preparing new documents on similar actions. This activity is referred to as &ldquo;transferred analyses.&rdquo; It has not been a common practice to do this within Reclamation; however, with the creation of electronic repositories of NEPA documents in the regions, Denver offices, and other agencies, the ability to access documents is now available, and preparers should take advantage of the stored data. Before adopting information, preparers must investigate its reliability, quality, and applicability to the current proposal. Data utilized in previous NEPA documents may be incorporated by reference. See ESM 10-17 and the discussion below (section 7.4) on incorporating by reference.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Before an NOI is published in the FR and scoping is formally initiated, a number of steps should be taken. At the beginning of the process, the action and the purpose and need for the action should be explicitly defined. This should involve a multidisciplinary team and management input and approval.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			With the definition of the proposed action, other environmental evaluations in the area that may be related to the action should be reviewed.

Every effort should be made to identify existing information and analysis applicable to the current action to reduce redundancy.

		<span id="bookmark138" class="c0 c1 c23">7.5.2 Restrictions on Actions</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			While the EIS is being prepared, Reclamation is limited in the actions it can take. Until a decision is made, no action concerning the project shall be taken that will have an impact on, or preclude the choice of, other reasonable alternatives. Such actions include commitment of funds, personnel, resources, or materials that will advance the proposal to a point from which retreat may be difficult or impractical. (40 CFR 1506.1).

	<p class="c7">
		<span id="bookmark139" class="c0 c1 c23">7.5.3 Timeframes (40 CFR 1501.8, 43 CFR 46.240)</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Preparation of an EIS should coincide with Reclamation&rsquo;s decisionmaking process so that it can be completed in time for the FEIS to be included in, or to accompany, any recommendations or reports. The EIS should be prepared early enough so that it can provide an important contribution to the decisionmaking process. An exception to this would be in circumstances where an emergency exists and there is not time to complete NEPA before action must be taken to protect public safety and/or natural resources.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation should establish a schedule for each EIS in consultation with the cooperating agencies. Cooperating agencies should be expected to complete any requested reviews and analysis within the defined schedule. Once this schedule is established, Reclamation is not required to (but may agree to) delay preparation of an FEIS if comments are not received within the defined schedule.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In establishing the schedule, several factors need to be considered: (1) issues involved (e.g., potential impact and the nature and extent of the proposed action); (2) public involvement and consultation with agencies and Indian tribes; (3) NEPA process and required time limits; (4) data collection needs; (5) relationship of the proposed action to related processes within and outside of Reclamation; and (6) legal constraints. Adequate time should be allowed for the preparation and processing of the DEIS or FEIS. The process can vary significantly&mdash;from less than 18 months to 3 or more years&mdash;depending upon the controversy, scope, and issues to be addressed. Sometimes an EIS may be court directed and have a mandatory completion date.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Usually, the more significant the issues, the greater the amount of time needed for preparation of an adequate EIS. If significant public controversy exists, an expanded public involvement program may be helpful in gathering data and reducing the potential for litigation, but it may extend the time needed to complete the EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The NEPA process includes a number of minimum required time limits. These limits may be extended at Reclamation&rsquo;s discretion. They are as follows:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="135">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">The</span>

			<span class="c0 c1">
				(40 CFR 1506.10(c) and (d)). There is no maximum time period.

			<span class="c1">1506</span>
			<span class="c0 c1">.10 (b)(2)). There is no maximum time period.</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The minimum review period for a DEIS (or any supplements) is 45 days from the date that EPA publishes the &ldquo;Notice of Availability of Weekly Receipt of Environmental Impact Statements&rdquo; in the FR (see figure 7.1). This notice, usually published on Fridays, lists all EISs filed with EPA during the preceding week (40 CFR 1506.10(a)). However, for a delegated DEIS, Reclamation has the flexibility to establish a longer comment period while still meeting all minimum review requirements stated above. This longer comment period may begin as early as when the document is filed with EPA and may be extended as long as Reclamation desires. The longer comment period is generally calculated from the publication date of Reclamation&rsquo;s NOA in the FR.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Data collection needs can be significant. NEPA requires that the lead agency collect data needed for a reasoned choice among alternatives if it can be collected at a less-than-exorbitant cost (40 CFR 1502.22(a)). The determination of exorbitant costs must include all applicable costs, including consideration of monetized, as well as nonmonetized, costs such as social costs, opportunity costs, and nontimely fulfillment of statutory mandates (43 CFR 46.125). Data collection can require significant time and should be factored into the development of a reasonable timeframe for completion of the EIS (see chapter 8, section 8.8.2).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Finally, the relationship of the proposed action to related processes within and outside of Reclamation must be understood in order to reasonably set an achievable timeframe. Internal processes, such as safety of dams evaluations and contract negotiations, have timeframes and scheduling requirements that should be integrated with the NEPA requirements for those actions into one Reclamation decisionmaking process. External processes such as ESA or CWA Section 404 compliance can significantly affect the development of a reasonable timeframe, so consultation and coordination should begin with the appropriate agencies as early as possible.

		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			All Reclamation notices to be published in the FR must be reviewed and surnamed in the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office and appropriate Interior offices. In addition, all notices must be reviewed and approved by the Federal Register Liaison (84-21300). Once approved, notices must be signed and emailed or faxed to the Special Assistant to the Deputy Commissioner, Policy, Administration and Budget (94-00010) with a cc to the Federal Register Liaison).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The Directors, Office of Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, meet daily with the Interior&rsquo;s Chief of Staff to recommend or give approval to publish each FR notice. The Federal Register Liaison (84-21300) will notify the originating office when approval to publish has been received.
		</span>
		<span class="c1 c23">
			Under no circumstances should a notice be sent directly to the Office of the Federal Register prior to receipt of approval by Interior. This review process may take up to 30 days or more to complete.
		</span>
		<span class="c1">
			To avoid delays, the originating office should send the NOA ahead of the rest of the EPA filing package for review and surnaming (see section 7.8 for information on preparing EPA filing packages). Publication emergencies can be avoided by allowing for the 30-day review in the FR notice preparation timeline.

It may also be an office in the TSC under a service agreement with the area or regional office. If this is the case, the draft notice is sent to the region for approval. If the study is Reclamation wide, the notice is prepared by Policy and Administration.

Directors in the Washington, Denver, and regional offices have the authority to sign program-specific notices for programs under their responsibility. The signatory authority may be delegated to a lower level at the discretion of the Director (Reclamation Manual, ADM 01-02, paragraph 3B).

The date of the actual signature must also be shown. Do not place a signature block on a page by itself (placing text on the signature page helps to ensure the integrity of the document). The date of signature and the name, title, and region of the signatory official should also be added to the file on the CD.

			Each region has internal review requirements that must be followed. These should include a broad review of the preliminary draft and final documents, before filing, by individuals with environmental compliance expertise to ensure adequacy. Review of the documents by any cooperating agencies is also appropriate at this time. Upon request, the TSC and/or Policy and Administration may review and/or assist in the revision of preliminary DEISs and/or FEISs.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A broader review by the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office may occur on highly complex or controversial actions. The office of the Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, the Office of the Solicitor, and OEPC may also get involved in the reviews. If the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office in Washington is involved in the review of a NEPA document, the preparing office should provide reviewers with preliminary drafts to avoid delays later on when the NEPA document is ready to be filed. The Regional Liaison usually coordinates the Commissioner&rsquo;s and applicable DOI office reviews with support from Reclamation&rsquo;s representative in the office of the ASWS.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A delegated EIS is one prepared for a proposed action for which decision authority is delegated to a single Assistant Secretary or further delegated to a subordinate bureau (see section 7.2.2). Within Reclamation, delegated EISs may be signed by the Commissioner or Regional Directors.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The area and regional offices are responsible for preparation, adequacy, and internal review of the document. This review will address the legal and technical adequacy of material presented, compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws, and adherence to Interior and Reclamation regulations, instructions, and policies. Special attention will be given to completeness and accuracy of the analysis. Additionally, the analysis of the alternatives will be critically evaluated to make sure an alternative or alternative feature that has less environmental impact, and that is legally and technically feasible, has not been inadvertently overlooked.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Review of preliminary copies of the DEIS by project sponsors and cooperating agencies is encouraged. The level of review and selection of the reviewing entities should be at the discretion of the office preparing the DEIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Technical peer review of the different sections is generally performed by another office. For example, material developed by the area offices would normally be reviewed by the regional office but may also be reviewed, upon request, by the TSC and/or Policy and Administration.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Review of documents covers all aspects, not just environmental compliance, and adequate time is needed to review the document&rsquo;s contents and to coordinate among the various disciplines involved in the review. These reviews (by sponsors, cooperating agencies, and peers) should be allowed 30 calendar days, whenever possible.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The originating office should make every effort to accommodate the policy and technical recommendations of the reviewing office. If a recommendation cannot be accommodated by the originating office, then the originating and reviewing offices should work together to develop an alternative approach that is acceptable to both offices or refer the disagreement to the decisionmaker for action.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			To facilitate preparation of the document, internal regional office comments and recommendations should be forwarded through informal channels (blue envelope, email, etc.) or discussed in a meeting or conference call between the originating office and regional office staff.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In rare instances, a Director or the Commissioner may request that Policy and Administration take the lead within Reclamation to prepare an EIS. This process would generally include the following steps: Policy and Administration would develop a team to prepare the document using resources from the TSC, the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, and the regions, as appropriate. The team would then develop an outline of the steps needed to complete the document. The outline would be reviewed internally by Policy and Administration, and other appropriate groups within Reclamation, before being sent to the Commissioner/Director requesting approval to initiate the EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			If the proposed action is determined to be of interest Reclamation wide, the preliminary draft would also be offered to all regions and other directors for review. The Director requesting the document would approve the draft before it was filed by Policy and Administration with EPA for public review.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Those regions and other directors who provided input on the draft would be given the opportunity to review the final document. The Director requesting the document would approve the final before it was filed with EPA.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Under ESM 11-2, nondelegated EISs are to be reviewed by the Secretary&rsquo;s OEPC. The office that originates the EIS will send an email or memorandum to the Director of OEPC requesting its approval to print, along with a copy of the document (see figure 7.8 for an example of an Approval to Print memorandum). To avoid any delays at the time of printing, the preparing office should include OEPC in reviews of preliminary drafts of the EIS or, if that is not possible, send a copy of the EIS to OEPC to review at least 2 weeks in advance of a request for approval to print.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In addition, the filing package for the nondelegated EIS will be somewhat different than that for a delegated EIS. It is likely to require more than the usual number of paper copies and CDs of the EIS. The transmittal letters to the EPA and Office of the Federal Register must be signed by the Director of OEPC. The letters may be prepared in the regional office on Office of the Secretary of the Interior letterhead and mailed to the Regional Liaison in Washington or emailed to the Regional Liaison to be put on Office of the Secretary of the Interior letterhead. The region will also email the NOA to the Regional Liaison. The NOA must include three originals with the OEPC Director&rsquo;s original signature (in blue ink), title, and date on each copy. The region should also include a copy of the NOA on a CD with the OEPC Director&rsquo;s name, title, and date of signature typed in the signatory block. A draft press release may also be required by the Office of Public Affairs. When Reclamation is preparing a nondelegated EIS, it will also forward a draft press release through its Assistant Secretary to the OEPC (if required by the Office of Public Affairs).

The Regional Liaison will also stamp or hand write the number on the front page or cover sheet of each paper copy of the DEIS/FEIS in the filing package. While it is not necessary for the regional or area offices to stamp all of the EIS copies being distributed to the public with the DES/FES control number, the Regional Liaison should provide the number to the regional office for its records.
		</span>
		<span class="c1 c23">Note:</span>
		<span class="c1">
			It is possible for someone in the regional office, rather than the Regional Liaison, to obtain the DES/FES control number from OEPC, as long as it is not requested more than 2 weeks before the document is ready to be published. When this is done by the region, the control number will already be included in the NOA and printed on the cover sheet of the document. It should be noted that the control number from OEPC is time sensitive, so if the number is obtained ahead of time, any delay in providing the document to EPA could invalidate the number and cause further delay as a new number is assigned.
		</span>

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The date that comments are due on a DEIS must appear on the cover sheet of the document (CEQ NEPA regulations, 40 CFR, Section 1502.11(f)). If this date is not included on the cover sheet, the Regional Liaison is responsible for stamping or hand writing it on the paper copy of each DEIS in the filing package. The comment due date must appear on the cover sheet of all documents being distributed to the public.
		</span>
		<span class="c1 c23">Note:</span>
		<span class="c1">
			It is very helpful if the regional/area office calculates the comment due date according to NEPA regulations and includes it on the cover sheet of the document before it goes to print.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			All copies of the EIS should be distributed concurrently with the filing date with EPA. At the time of filing, EPA will ask if all copies have been distributed. Therefore, immediately after the Regional Liaison has obtained a DES/FES control number, he or she should coordinate with the regional office to agree on a filing date (see section 7.5.3 for important information on coordinating timeframes and comment periods).

			The minimum review period for a DEIS (or any supplements) is 45 days starting from when EPA publishes the &ldquo;Notice of Availability of Weekly Receipt of Environmental Impact Statements&rdquo; in the FR. This timeframe may be extended at the agency&rsquo;s discretion (see section 7.9.3 below). However, Reclamation may also start the comment period earlier, while still meeting all the minimum review requirements. This longer comment period may begin as early as when the document is filed with EPA and may extend as long as Reclamation desires. The longer comment period is generally calculated from the publication date of Reclamation&rsquo;s NOA in the FR. For nondelegated EISs, the originating office would be responsible for consulting with OEPC about any proposed reduction or extension of the commenting process. The OEPC would notify EPA and CEQ about the changes.

			Public hearings are not required for every DEIS but should be held if: (1) there is substantial controversy concerning the proposed action or substantial interest in holding the hearing; or (2) an agency with jurisdiction over the action requests a hearing supported by reasons why a hearing will be helpful (40 CFR 1506.6(c)). A public hearing is a more formal type of public meeting used to gather comments from the public. While not required, it is recommended that a court reporter and a hearing officer be utilized to conduct the hearing. A hearing is not the place to debate the merits or drawbacks of the project. If a question-and&shy; answer period is desirable, it should be scheduled informally before or after the formal hearing, with the understanding that the informal question-and-answer period is not part of the formal hearing record. A question-and-answer period before the hearing can often aid the public in focusing its comments on the DEIS and the issues related to it. The hearing record should be left open for written public comment for 10 to 15 days after the date(s) of the public hearing(s).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The public hearing session(s) should be conducted by a hearing moderator in a manner that will encourage the fullest possible participation. All written comments from the public hearing and a summary of oral comments at the public hearing, along with Reclamation&rsquo;s responses, will be made a part of an appendix in the FEIS.

	<ol class="c42" start="189">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Evaluate the merits of the request and determine whether there is time to extend it. Reclamation staff will need to examine the reasons why the commenter wants to extend the comment period (i.e., there may be new issues, or they may have received the EIS late or not at all). There may not be time to extend the comment period (i.e., the NEPA process may need to be completed to meet certain statutory requirements or other mandates, such as renewal of water contracts). General practice within Reclamation is to try to accommodate all reasonable requests if there is time.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				If an extension of time is granted, the preparing office should notify the appropriate parties on the mailing list of the extension, put it on the region&rsquo;s Web site, and consider issuing a press release.

A supplement may be prepared for a DEIS or FEIS. If prepared for a DEIS, the draft supplement should be integrated with the existing DEIS during preparation of the FEIS for the proposed action. If prepared after the EIS is filed, both a draft and a final supplement will generally be prepared.

In these cases, it may be necessary or desirable to cancel the EIS. This process can also be referred to as withdrawing an EIS, terminating an EIS, or cessation of an EIS. Interior recommends that DEISs that have not had FEISs prepared within 5 years be reviewed to ensure they are still relevant. Interior periodically reviews and develops a list of DEISs that fall within this category and may recommend that Reclamation cancel them. In addition, if an NOI is prepared and a DEIS is not completed within 5 years, a similar review is appropriate to ensure the EIS process is still relevant.

		<span class="c1">
			To achieve NEPA&rsquo;s purposes for an EIS (see chapters 2 and 3), Reclamation offices shall prepare EISs in the following manner:
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">EISs shall:</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="197">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Be prepared by an interdisciplinary team, formed as soon as an EIS is determined to be likely, and integrated into all aspects of project development.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">Be analytic rather than encyclopedic.</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Discuss impacts in proportion to their significance, with only a brief discussion of less-than-significant issues. As in an EA, only enough discussion should be included to show why more study is not warranted.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Be concise and no longer than absolutely necessary to comply with NEPA and CEQ regulations. Length should vary primarily with potential environmental issues and then with project complexity.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				State how alternatives considered in the EIS and decisions based on it will or will not achieve the objectives defined in Sections 101 and 102(1) of NEPA and other environmental laws and policies.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c24">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Present a range of alternatives to be considered by the ultimate agency decisionmakers.
			</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The document should not be written in such a way that it appears to justify decisions already made or to promote an alternative. The analysis must remain objective and free from editorial comment.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			EIS preparers should strive to keep EISs within the normal 150-page limit set by the CEQ regulations. For proposals of unusual scope and complexity, the CEQ regulations state that documents shall normally not exceed 300 pages in length. However, proposals of great complexity sometimes result in EISs that require more analyses and documentation and can be even greater in length. This should be the exception and not the norm. The document should be written in a clear, concise fashion, based on the necessary environmental analysis. Every attempt should be made to avoid overly technical language or jargon. The text and appropriate graphics should be presented so the decisionmakers and the public can readily understand them.

			Sections a, b, c, h, i, and j are required and shall be in any format used. The substance of sections d, e, f, g, and k shall also be included in any EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The EIS may be organized in several ways. Some of the more common variations are:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="203">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				A combined &ldquo;Affected Environment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Environmental Consequences&rdquo; discussion
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Separate &ldquo;Affected Environment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Environmental Consequences&rdquo; sections
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Display effects on an alternative-by-alternative basis, analyzing each affected resource or feature under one alternative before turning to the next alternative and its effects
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c24">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Describe one affected resource, or a group of similar resources, followed by a comparison of the impacts of each alternative upon it on an alternative-by-alternative basis
			</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c0 c1">
			All of these approaches, or different combinations of them, are acceptable. Generally, the combined &ldquo;Affected Environment/Environmental Consequences&rdquo; chapter is more difficult to write but is considered by some to be easier for the reader, and it reduces redundancy. An EIS with more than a few alternatives and resources to be analyzed may use separate chapters to best present the information so readers can compare alternatives. The EIS team should carefully consider which of these presentations is most appropriate for a particular EIS. Each environmental resource or feature should be analyzed by alternative in the same manner; each should have the net environmental effects, or residual impacts, given in summary form either at the beginning or end of the discussion. When the analyses are complete, their net effects should be summarized and placed in tabular form at the conclusion of the section.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c0 c1">
			Alternatives and resources should be presented in the same order throughout the document. Generally, the no action alternative is presented first to form the basis for comparison of impacts among the action alternatives. If the impacts of an alternative are the same as those of a previously presented alternative, then this fact should be noted, and the impacts should not necessarily be restated. If the impacts of the alternative are significantly different than those of the previously presented alternatives, these significant impacts should be described in detail.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c0 c1">
			When listed species or designated critical habitat, ITAs, sacred sites, or environmental justice may be affected, impacts should be specifically addressed in separate, identified sections. If appropriate, the EIS should explicitly state that there are no ITA or environmental justice issues related to the proposed action.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span id="bookmark168" class="c0 c1 c23">8.2.1 Organization by Affected Resources or Features</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The most commonly used organization of analysis is by affected resource area (e.g., water quality impacts are discussed in one location for all the alternatives). If the affected resources approach is used, the resources to be affected are discussed along with historic and present conditions and no action conditions; then, the impacts of the alternatives on the affected resource or feature are presented alternative by alternative and are compared to the no action alternative. If a resource or feature will not be affected by the alternatives, and the resource or feature is of significant local concern, the fact that the parameter will not be affected should be stated. The fact that alternatives may have the same or similar impacts should be stated and supported&mdash;it is not necessary to redescribe each and every impact of similar alternatives upon a given resource or feature.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c7">
		<span id="bookmark169" class="c0 c1 c23">8.2.2 Organization on an Alternative-by-Alternative Basis</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The impacts analysis can, instead, be presented on an alternative-by-alternative basis, in which all of the impacts of one alternative for all of the affected resource areas are grouped together; then, the impacts of the next alternative are presented, etc. If the alternative-by-alternative approach is used, the impacts of each alternative are described on a resource-by-resource basis under each alternative. The impacts of the action alternatives are determined by comparison to the no action alternative. In the absence of reasonably foreseeable changes, the no action alternative may be no different than the existing affected environment. If it is different, the differences between the existing affected environment and the no action alternative should be discussed.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			When separate alternatives have the same impact on a resource or feature, redundancy can be reduced by analyzing the impacts of one alternative and simply referring back to that analysis for other alternatives with similar impacts.

It should adequately and accurately summarize the EIS and contain at least four elements&mdash;the purpose and need statement, the alternatives considered, a comparison of impacts of the alternatives, and identification of the preferred alternative (if known for the DEIS, and always for the FEIS). The summary shall emphasize the major conclusions, areas of controversy, issues raised by agencies and the public, and the issues to be resolved, including the choice of alternatives. It should include a clear definition of the action and the alternatives considered in the EIS (including the no action alternative). It should also include a comparison of the alternatives that highlights unresolved or controversial issues, with appropriate discussion of ITA, sacred sites, and environmental justice issues. It should not contain material not found in the main EIS and should be less than 15 pages long. The format should parallel the format of the EIS.

		<span id="bookmark172" class="c5 c1">8.5 Purpose and Need Statement (40 CFR 1502.13)</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			This section shall present a brief statement explaining why the action is being considered&mdash;the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding. This brief statement is a critical element that sets the overall direction of the process and serves as an important screening criterion for determining which alternatives are reasonable. All reasonable alternatives examined in detail must meet the defined purpose and need.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Interior&rsquo;s regulations at 43 CFR 46.420(a)(1) indicate that, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.13, &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;need&rdquo; may be described as distinct aspects defining the underlying situation that the agency is responding to. The &ldquo;need&rdquo; for action is the underlying problem the agency wants to fix or the opportunity to which the agency is responding with the action. The &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; is the goals or objectives that the agency is trying to achieve. Under this language, the purpose may be equated with the desired future condition. Note that this separate treatment of purpose and need is not required, and a single brief statement addressing purpose and need together may be adequate. The presentation is at the responsible official&rsquo;s discretion.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A brief background discussion may be included for additional information, as appropriate. Appropriate background information can include a brief history leading to the current situation, a summary of the authorizations that exist for the action, the legal constraints that limit action, and other information that assists a
		</span>
		<span class="c0 c1">
			reader in understanding how the purpose of and need for the project came to exist. This background discussion should be general and not tied to any specific alternative.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Care must be taken to ensure an objective presentation rather than a justification. A purpose and need statement will generally allow a limited range of reasonable alternatives. If a purpose and need statement appears to allow only one reasonable solution, the statement, as well as the reasons for rejecting other alternatives, should be re-examined and confirmed or revised, as appropriate.

		<span id="bookmark173" class="c0 c1 c23">8.5.1 Defining the Federal Action</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Simultaneously with the development of the purpose and need statement, the EIS should define, in a brief statement, what Federal action is under consideration. The Federal action is not necessarily the same thing as the preferred alternative, nor (especially for applicant-driven actions) the proposed action. The Federal action is the general response to the purpose and need and has a number of alternatives. For example, if the purpose and need statement indicates that a refuge is suffering from disease problems because of low water during the summer months, the proposed Federal action could be defined as supplying water to the refuge; the alternatives would encompass ways in which to supply water to the refuge (ground water, pipeline, new reservoir, etc.).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The proposed action should be defined in terms of the Federal decision to be made. When the proposed action is related to other actions&mdash;especially other Federal actions&mdash;a careful consideration of the independent value of the proposed action should be made. When the independence of the proposed action is not clear, it may be appropriate to expand the scope to include those other actions.

			When preparing an EIS, the preferred alternative and other action alternatives studied in detail should receive comparable levels of analysis. CEQ requires the environmental impacts of the preferred alternative and reasonable alternatives to be presented in comparative form, sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice (&sect; 1502.14). The emphasis is upon comparability of the environmental effects, not on whether every alternative has been developed to exactly the same degree of detail. The presentation of alternatives should focus on differences&mdash;where alternatives are the same, the text can be reduced by referring to the descriptions of alternatives already discussed. Mitigating measures to reduce or eliminate adverse environmental consequences should be integrated into the action alternatives.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A no action alternative must always be evaluated in the EIS. Because the no action alternative is the basis to which all other alternatives are compared, it should be presented first, so the reader can easily compare the other alternatives to it. &ldquo;No action&rdquo; represents a projection of current conditions and reasonably foreseeable actions to the most reasonable future responses or conditions that could occur during the life of the project without any action alternatives being implemented.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The no action alternative should not automatically be considered the same as the existing condition of the affected environment because reasonably foreseeable future actions may occur whether or not any of the project action alternatives are chosen. When the no action alternative is different from the existing condition, as projected into the future, the differences should be clearly defined. Differences could result from other water development projects, land use changes, municipal development, or other actions. &ldquo;No action&rdquo; is, therefore, often described as &ldquo;the future without the project.&rdquo; Sufficient discussion should be devoted to the no action alternative so that readers can make the needed comparisons for the evaluation. For O&amp;M studies, the no action alternative assumes continuing current O&amp;M activities with no change.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			For projects with staged development, in which major features have been constructed but the project is not yet operational, it is not appropriate to select a no action alternative that assumes existing project facilities would not be used or would be removed. The appropriate characterization would be to assume an operational scenario based on those existing facilities. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to operate a project that is only partially constructed. In those instances, the no action alternative could describe a situation in which existing facilities would not be put into service. Authorized projects in the area being carried out by Reclamation, other Federal agencies, or other entities, with a reasonable certainty of occurring, should be considered in the no action alternative as being constructed. A project may be reasonably foreseeable if it is included in a party&rsquo;s master plans or development plans, the necessary approvals have been granted, funds appropriated, and other necessary compliance requirements met.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In examining the range of alternatives, CEQ&rsquo;s memorandum of July 22, l983, states, in part, that &ldquo;an agency&rsquo;s responsibilities to examine alternative sites have always been bounded by some notion of feasibility.&rdquo; CEQ stresses that agencies should not disregard the &ldquo;common sense realities&rdquo; of a given situation in developing alternatives. While this guidance is aimed at considering alternatives to an applicant&#39;s proposal, it has equal relevance in considering proposals generated within Reclamation (i.e., when considering the range of viable alternatives to the preferred action, the agency should strive for a realistic range of alternatives that reasonably could be considered and that will accomplish the project purpose and need). The range should include alternatives based upon input from other agencies, the public at large, and local community interests. If one or more community alternative(s) exist, and it is feasible and practical, it should be included in the EIS.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The lead agency has the ultimate responsibility to determine the appropriate range of alternatives. This decision can be controversial. Where substantial controversy may exist concerning the range selected, the criteria used to limit the alternatives should be explicitly defined by Reclamation and logically supported.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Action alternatives include the proposed action and all other feasible and reasonable alternatives that will be evaluated in the EIS. Reclamation must consider potentially reasonable alternatives beyond its own jurisdiction and consider the jurisdictions of other agencies (Federal and otherwise) when determining what reasonable alternatives should be considered. If an alternative outside an agency&rsquo;s authority became the preferred alternative, implementation would depend on a change in authorization, a change of lead Federal agency to one with the appropriate authority, or a transfer of the project to a non-Federal entity. It could also lead to the cancellation of the project.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Each action alternative should address the purpose of and need for the action as described in the &ldquo;Purpose and Need&rdquo; chapter of the document. The discussion of alternatives should also state how each alternative would or would not achieve the requirements of Section 101 and 102 (1) of NEPA and other environmental laws and policies. The appropriate discussion should be presented for each alternative so that reviewers may evaluate the environmental impacts of each alternative by comparing them to the no action alternative. The proposed action (see section 7.5.1) should be identified in the document to make the readers aware of the action that is being contemplated, allowing them to focus their review on that action.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Because issues and objectives may be complex and sometimes competing, a particular alternative should be a distinctly different approach from others and may emphasize the achievement of some objectives at the expense of others. Minor variations should be considered subalternatives rather than separate alternatives. Any reasonable alternative with anticipated environmental consequences that differ significantly from those of the preferred alternative should be considered a major alternative and analyzed fully.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			For clarity, each major alternative should be given a descriptive name, number, or letter, although a descriptive name is preferred to a number or letter. When an alternative is assigned a number or letter the first time it is presented, and, thereafter, it is presented by the letter or number, it can be problematic because it is difficult for most readers to retain and associate the number or letter with that particular alternative throughout the remainder of the EIS. For instance, it is easier for the reader to associate an alternative with a name like &ldquo;San Juan Alignment&rdquo; than it is to retain &ldquo;Alternative 3&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alternative C.&rdquo; In addition, it is easier to change the order in which alternatives designated by name appear than it is to change those designated by letter or number.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The discussion of the alternatives should conclude with a graphic comparison of the alternatives that is based mainly on the impact summaries found in the &ldquo;Environmental Consequences&rdquo; chapter.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Mitigation measures and environmental commitments that are to be incorporated as a result of the EIS&rsquo;s analyses should be integrated into the appropriate alternatives. These mitigation measures then become an integral part of those alternatives&mdash;in other words, those particular alternatives cannot be described without the mitigation measures. However, other alternatives without the integrated mitigation measures may also be reasonable and should still be included.

	<p class="c3">

			Any additional mitigation measures not integrated into the action alternatives will be included in the &ldquo;Environmental Commitments&rdquo; section of the EIS.

The instruction in the CEQ regulations to &ldquo;Include reasonable alternatives not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency&rdquo; (40 CFR 1502.14(c)) indicates that alternatives beyond an agency&rsquo;s authority may be included, but other factors may still cause such an alternative to be unreasonable and not analyzed in detail.

		<span class="c1">
			The issue of reasonableness is a judgment call by Reclamation. Usually, after scoping an action, Reclamation will have an idea if an alternative may be unreasonable to implement due to social, cultural, or political realities. During the process of eliminating alternatives, the interdisciplinary team should develop a set of screening criteria against which all alternatives should be measured. This will assist in making the process more objective and defensible. The criteria could include such items as cost limits, geographic boundaries, scheduling goals, or time constraints. Some of these items may be dictated by the authorization for the project.

It should be noted that CEQ regulations do not require the identification of a preferred alternative in a DEIS if none has been determined. If an alternative exists which has the consensus of the affected community and it is reasonable and practicable, meets the purpose and need for action, and is within Reclamation&rsquo;s statutory authority to implement, Reclamation should designate it as the preferred alternative or explicitly explain why it was not so designated (43 CFR 46.110).

			The preferred alternative should be an alternative that completes the action and that best meets the purpose and need for the action as defined in the EIS. Defining the preferred alternative does not define the agency&rsquo;s final decision. It is not necessary to provide a separate discussion in the EIS on the rationale for selection of a preferred alternative. That specific discussion is most appropriate for the ROD. The intention is to let the public know what the agency considers the best alternative, based upon the information available.

			This section should begin with a general description of the physical environment of the project area and a map defining the project area, the associated ecosystem(s), and the affected environment. The entire area of potential effect is included in the discussion of affected environment, including potentially affected areas outside the immediate project area. If available, the historic changes and trends affecting a resource or feature, up to and including present conditions, should be described to set the stage for the projection of future changes and trends concerning the resource or feature. Emphasis should be placed on environmental parameters that would be significantly affected by the alternatives. Only brief treatment should be given to characteristics that would not be affected. This brief treatment can include a statement that no further analysis of the resource is included in the EIS. All EISs should include a clearly labeled discussion of cultural resources, sacred sites, ITAs, and environmental justice.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			For critical environmental areas or issues&mdash;such as ITAs, invasive species, environmental justice, cultural resources, and T&amp;E species&mdash;a brief discussion of ongoing activities that may affect them is needed. When ongoing activities may be having significant effects upon these areas or issues, the discussion should summarize both the significance of the ongoing effect and what specific ongoing activity is causing the effect, even when the alternatives do not address these effects.

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The general description constitutes a basis from which specific environmental effects can be assessed.

		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			When discussing the area resource or feature affected by each alternative, the discussions become far more specific than in the general description and provide details on those features which would be affected by the project. For instance, if alternative B is found in the Sonoran Desert Life Zone but is in an area with a high number of Joshua trees, the Sonoran Desert Life Zone should be discussed in the general description, and the specific description of the Joshua trees should be saved for the vegetation parameter under the alternative. This organization allows the flexibility to provide a complete general description of the project area, while at the same time avoiding detailed and specific description of parameters that will only be affected by one alternative.

			If two or more alternatives share the same affected environment (as will often be the case), it is not necessary to repeat the description of that environment. Instead, reference should be made to the description already provided. For instance, if the preferred alternative would affect 300 acres of riparian vegetation, the area should be described in sufficient detail that the extent and severity of the impact on it are understood. However, if another alternative involves the same 300 acres of riparian vegetation, plus an additional 50-acre parcel of the same vegetation, the description of the original 300 acres would not be repeated for this other alternative.

			The appropriate investigations, data collection, and data analysis that are required to identify and quantify direct and indirect impacts and to develop project features, including enhancement and mitigation features, should be conducted by technically qualified persons.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c0 c1">
			Some examples of direct impacts are those associated with highway and railroad relocations; reductions in downstream flows; loss of a natural stream or river; or losses of fish, wildlife, endangered species, archeological sites, farmland, wetlands, homes, oil wells, or unique areas caused by the construction of a dam and related water conveyance system.

		<span class="c0 c1">
			Although indirect impacts are frequently difficult to identify and measure, the indirect impacts that can reasonably be expected to occur, should Reclamation proceed with a given proposal, need to be analyzed. However, such potential indirect effects can only be meaningfully analyzed if they are measurably different from no action conditions.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c0 c1">
			Indirect effects, as defined in the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.8(b)), may include growth-inducing effects, changes in land use, changes in population density, or changes in growth rate and related effects on natural systems. The potential for a Reclamation proposal to cause these types of indirect effects must be examined in light of whether the proposal is the principal cause of these effects (the &ldquo;but-for&rdquo; issue) or is incidental (secondary) to effects that are likely to occur anyway because of some other activities. Future development projects may be determined by reviewing local planning documents and zoning ordinances. If the proposal&rsquo;s effects are incidental to development and land use that is planned and addressed in local planning documents, this should be documented, and no further analysis is necessary. Other types of analysis may also adequately document that Reclamation actions do not have indirect effects. For example, analysis may show that Reclamation actions related to water supply delivery are not responsible for indirect effects when the water supply is a replacement supply or when it can be demonstrated that other water supply alternatives would reasonably be implemented (because of cost and availability) in lieu of the Reclamation action. See discussions in Section 4.13, Changing Water Use, and Section 11.6, How Much is Enough? in this handbook.

		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			CEQ regulations implementing NEPA define cumulative impacts as:
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c47 c37">
		<span class="c1">
			The impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person under takes such actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually mi nor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Cumulative impacts are to be considered along with direct and indirect effects in determining the scope of an EIS. The scoping process should be designed to identify associated actions (past, present, or future) which, when viewed with the proposed or alternative actions, may have cumulative significant impacts. Future cumulative impacts should not be speculative but should be based upon known or reasonably foreseeable long-range plans, regulations, operating agreements, or other information that establishes them as reasonably foreseeable. An office may establish explicit criteria for an individual EIS to define future actions which are reasonably foreseeable in a particular situation.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Note that the definition of cumulative impacts is different under NEPA than ESA. CEQ&rsquo;s definition in its NEPA regulations is broader than the ESA and encompasses all reasonably foreseeable future actions, including Federal actions.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Cumulative impacts under the ESA include those actions under NEPA (State, tribal, local, and private actions) but exclude Federal actions unrelated to the proposed action that have not undergone ESA Section 7 consultation. This distinction should be noted if a BA is being integrated into the NEPA document as opposed to being appended to it.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Cumulative impacts can be categorized as additive or interactive. An additive impact emerges from persistent additions from one kind of source, whether through time or space. An interactive impact results from more than one kind of source. Piecemeal physical destruction of wetlands is additive; physical destruction of wetlands combined with damage from toxic substances is interactive.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The courts have addressed different aspects of cumulative effects analysis in NEPA documents, including an agency&rsquo;s failure to address additive and interactive effects and the methodology used to analyze cumulative effects. Reclamation needs to undertake a thorough analysis of cumulative effects in its NEPA documents and to ensure that the scientific methodology it is using is appropriate and accurate. CEQ guidance (June 24, 2005) and Interior regulations (43 CFR 46.115) both indicate that an exhaustive analysis of past actions is not necessary. Past actions are to be analyzed in the context of the information&rsquo;s usefulness to the agency&rsquo;s analysis of the proposed action and alternatives. Reclamation retains considerable discretion &ldquo;as to extent of such inquiry and the appropriate level of explanation.&rdquo;
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Cumulative impacts can be presented in the document in a variety of ways. Inclusion of past and present cumulative impacts in the affected environment and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the no action alternative is encouraged. This approach aids the reader in making the comparison of action alternative effects to no action as required by CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.14). Alternatively, a separate section that consolidates all cumulative impacts can be prepared, but this approach often results in repeating background information and leads to a disjointed analysis. While commonly used, this approach is not now generally recommended. Either of these presentations can also be used with a resource by resource basis, which is recommended. That is, when discussing wetlands, for example, all the direct, indirect, residual, net, and cumulative impacts to wetlands related to the alternative being presented would be described.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			While an expectation exists among reviewers and the public that there will be a separate section discussing cumulative impacts, the most appropriate means to include cumulative impacts within the document is at the discretion of Reclamation. There is no required format for presenting cumulative impacts. It is required, however, to include cumulative impacts within the scope of the analysis. It is recommended that the discussion(s) of cumulative impacts be clearly labeled so that, even if not in a unique section, the reader can readily find and understand how cumulative effects are presented in the document.

			A discussion of reasonable and appropriate mitigation is required for identified impacts. When the proposed action is an applicant&rsquo;s proposal, the proposal must include, at a minimum, those design elements required to comply with all applicable environmental laws. Reclamation should analyze the applicant&rsquo;s proposal and may propose additional, reasonable mitigation to address impacts. This additional mitigation may, with the applicant&rsquo;s approval, be integrated into the proposal or may be presented as a separate alternative.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Mitigation measures can include proposals that avoid an impact, changes that minimize an impact, actions that reduce an impact, or actions that compensate for the impact.

		</span>

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The effects of mitigation measures should be analyzed in the Environmental Consequences discussion in two ways. First, the impacts of the mitigation feature will be discussed. For example, if Reclamation purchases a 500-acre farm as wildlife habitat replacement, certain social and economic impacts occur by taking this farm out of agricultural production and off the local tax rolls. These impacts come from the purchase of the mitigation feature and need to be analyzed. Second, the mitigation potential of the habitat replacement area and the extent to which this will reduce the impacts on a given environmental resource or feature should be addressed. In the case of the 500-acre farm, this would be an analysis of its habitat potential and how much this would lessen the impact on wildlife habitat. The change in net wildlife habitat due to the alternative under discussion, including the 500-acre habitat replacement, is the impact.

			The index, which is required for the FEIS and recommended for the DEIS, should be arranged in a double-column format and placed at the end of the report, before appendices and attachments. The style for entries may be found in the 2008 Government Printing Office Style Manual. To prepare an adequate index, the following points should be kept in mind:
		</span>

	<ol class="c42" start="260">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				An introduction to the index should be prepared to explain symbols or abbreviations used. The introduction also explains anything unique or different about the index.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				The index is a listing of names, places, and topics in alphabetical order with page numbers indicating where they are discussed. It helps the reader find information. Therefore, headings and topics selected should be those most familiar to the average reader. However, the index may be cross-referenced with the specialist in mind.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				The index should be as specific as possible. For example, biological entries should be at the species level; air quality entries should be by components (sulfur dioxide, particulates); socio-economic entries would be by specific unit of measurement (housing, elementary schools, police protection, fire protection); and so on.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c24">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Two categories&mdash;one specific and one general&mdash;should not be enumerated for the same entry. For example, if a species like &ldquo;bald eagle&rdquo; is enumerated under &ldquo;endangered species,&rdquo; the general heading should not also be enumerated (an entry &ldquo;endangered species&rdquo; could be used, but it should be further broken down into species).

				The most common synonyms should be used as cross-references. When a large part of the expected readership might be familiar with one particular term rather than its synonyms, both terms and cross-references should be indexed (generally from the less well-known term to the better known one). For example, if a number of readers use the term &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; and are not familiar with the fact that such topics are discussed under &ldquo;air quality,&rdquo; then &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; should be an index entry which refers the reader to &ldquo;air quality.&rdquo;

				A common mistake in preparing indexes is to heavily index the first 50 pages of the document and then slide over the remaining pages. To avoid this error, some criterion of selection has to be used to pick out the significant topics.

		<span class="c1">
			An ideal index should cover the complete contents of a document, including the summary, introduction, footnotes, and bibliography if these contain important information not found elsewhere in the document. However, if it becomes necessary to make choices, the most significant topics should receive the best coverage in the index.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The key element in any index is consistency. Once a certain selection method has been used, it should be used throughout. Once symbols, abbreviations, or acronyms have been designated, these same symbols, abbreviations, and acronyms should be used throughout. An arbitrary and preselected index should not be imposed on the document. The index must grow from within the document. Reclamation may prepare the index or it may be prepared under contract.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The index should not be prepared until the document has received final review and has final page numbers. When authorization to print the EIS is received, the index can be prepared and added.

When comments are repetitive, the significant comments may be summarized and consolidated to condense the volume of the responses. Even in this case, all comments should be addressed and a clear reference to each comment made so that an individual commenter can track individual comments. Some circumstances may dictate an alternative approach that would be more effective. Any corrections to the body of the statement should be referenced by section title and/or page number so the reviewer will be able to find the new material. A list of the commenters may be provided before the Comment and Response section to aid in identifying the location of the comments.

			The ROD cannot be issued until at least 30 days after EPA has published the NOA for the FEIS. It can be released later, at the discretion of the lead agency. If there is a decision made to select the no action alternative (as a decision, not as a determination that no decision exists), a ROD should be issued documenting that decision. In the unusual circumstance where an EIS was prepared for an action and, upon further analysis, Reclamation determines there is no decision to be made, a ROD will not be issued.

		<span class="c1">
			A ROD shall be prepared to accompany a decisionmaking package through the decision process. A ROD will apply only to actions for which an EIS has been prepared. There is no required format for a ROD, but certain topics must be addressed. The ROD, whether separate or as part of another decision document, must address:
		</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c42" start="278">
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				The decision and the alternatives considered, which should be the same ones covered in the EIS or PR/EIS, including the preferred plan. The decision should be within the range of alternatives addressed in the FEIS.
			</span>
		</li>

			<span class="c0 c1">
				The alternative(s) considered to be environmentally preferable.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				The factors that were considered with respect to the alternatives. Factors&mdash;including considerations of national policy&mdash;that were evaluated will be identified, and the ROD will state how those considerations entered into the decision. Additional factors that may be weighed include environmental impacts; social, economic, or technical considerations; Reclamation&#39;s statutory mission and authorities; water policy directives; and other related factors. If the information is included in existing decision documents, the final ROD will need to identify the alternative selected.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c6">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Whether or not all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm for the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why. A summary of environmental commitments and mitigation measures should be presented, where applicable.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c24">
			<span class="c0 c1">
				Any monitoring and enforcement program established to ensure that identified mitigation measures are accomplished. The ROD should also address actions Reclamation would take if monitoring shows that mitigation is inadequate, unnecessary, or unsuccessful (also, see section 8.12, Environmental Commitments). See figure 9.1 for an example of a ROD.
			</span>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Additionally, the ROD should address significant comments received on the FEIS during the period between the filing of the FEIS with EPA and preparation of the ROD, along with Reclamation&rsquo;s responses, as appropriate. See further discussion in section 9.4 below. Significant issues raised on the FEIS should generally be identified in the transmittal of the ROD. There is no appeals process provided for RODs under the CEQ regulations.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The ROD will also include a statement that there will be no impacts to ITAs or a statement describing the expected impacts of the proposed action on ITAs; a listing of any unresolved ITA issues; a list of commitments to prevent, mitigate, or compensate adverse impacts to ITAs; and a summary of any mitigation, monitoring, and enforcement programs related to ITAs (Reclamation memo, December 15, 1993).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The ROD should explain how the outcome of community involvement in the NEPA process may have influenced the final decision (i.e., consideration of any community alternatives, mitigation measures, and monitoring plans that were developed using consensus-based management, if applicable). (See Guidance Memorandum entitled Guidance on Use of Consensus-Based Management in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Process, September 21, 2004, in attachments). On items where consensus was reached within the community and Reclamation decided to take a different course, the ROD should explain what legal and substantive considerations entered into the decision.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The ROD must discuss any consensus-based alternatives developed during the EIS process. This discussion should include how consensus-based management was applied to the process and what alternatives (if any) were developed using consensus-based management.

			In all cases of NEPA compliance, means to mitigate significant adverse environmental impacts should be presented and adopted, wherever possible. NEPA does not require mitigation measures to be adopted for all impacts; however, it does encourage mitigation of impacts to the fullest extent possible and wherever practicable. Additionally, other statutes (e.g., ESA, NHPA) may require mitigation actions, which should also be identified here. Any environmental mitigation or enhancement measures that Reclamation plans to implement are termed &ldquo;environmental commitments.&rdquo; Once in the ROD, these are legal commitments, and Reclamation has clear obligations to implement them. They must be presented clearly in the final NEPA document and ROD or FONSI (as applicable), funded appropriately, included in plans and specifications, and followed as an integral part of the action to ensure that they are implemented and operating as planned. Specifications writers and inspectors should be very aware of environmental commitments as they conduct their work to ensure the commitments are integrated with other project work.

			A list of environmental commitments is an appropriate part of any environmental document and is especially important in a ROD, when the list of commitments is a part of the required description of the action. If there are no environmental commitments, this fact should be noted. Figure 9.1 includes an example of a ROD that contains a list of environmental commitments. The list of environmental commitments should consist of those identified in the compliance documents, MOUs, and/or correspondence with other agencies and public or private entities.

			The ROD would generally contain a summary of the substantive comments received on the FEIS. This summary should be brief and should only address the significant issues raised by the comments received. Only in special circumstances should any specific comments be responded to in the ROD. If the comments raise significant issues that have not been addressed, the need to supplement the FEIS should be considered and a determination made (please see section 7.11, Supplemental Statements, in chapter 7). The ROD should also identify particular areas of controversy and any unresolved issues that exist.

			A draft ROD will generally be prepared by the staff responsible for developing the EIS or PR/EIS. After approval by the program or area manager, the draft ROD is usually submitted to the Office of the Director, who has the authority to sign the ROD. The appropriate staff in these offices (most likely the environmental staff) will review the ROD for policy compliance and format. Staff in these offices may already be involved in drafting the ROD. Any necessary revisions will usually be made by the originating office. For EISs prepared in the area offices and regional offices, the Regional Director usually signs the ROD. The Commissioner, the Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, or the Secretary may sign some controversial or programmatic RODs. Upon signature, the signed original will be returned to the originating office for retention. A ROD cannot be executed until 30 days have elapsed after EPA publishes notification of FEIS filing in the FR, except under the conditions of 40 CFR 1506.10.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			On actions requiring a decision by the Secretary, the ROD is usually prepared for the Commissioner&rsquo;s signature with a line for the Secretary&#39;s signature. The ROD will be transmitted from the Commissioner, through the Assistant Secretary for Water and Science for concurrence, and then to the Secretary. RODs are considered public documents and must be provided to the public upon request (40 CFR 1506.6 (b)). There is no requirement to formally publish the ROD in the FR or the media. However, the responsible official in the region must ensure that the affected public is aware of the availability of the ROD. Appropriate means must be used to ensure widespread notification to involved agencies, organizations, and communities.

			Sometimes, because of procedural errors or administrative decisions, the recision of a ROD will have to take place. In order to rescind a ROD, Reclamation should develop a notice for the FR that is similar to a Notice of Cancellation, but it will be a Notice of Recision. Development of notices must follow the format requirements of the FR. To ensure consistency with current format requirements, the notice should be sent via e-mail to the Federal Register Liaison Officer currently located in Denver (84-213000).

	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			For RODs that include environmental commitments, the appropriate program director, usually the Regional Director, should consider developing an environmental commitments program. The environmental commitments program helps to ensure that all environmental project features (mitigation and enhancement) are included, developed, and operated concurrent with other project features. There is no required content or format for the program, but it is recommended that an environmental commitments program include the preparation of an environmental commitments plan (ECP); if necessary, a program to adaptively manage the outcome of the decision; an environmental commitments checklist (ECC); and postconstruction environmental commitment summaries.

			The ECP is a master in-house environmental management plan for projects requiring the preparation of NEPA documents. The ECP is based on the list of environmental commitments included in the NEPA document and other subsequent commitments such as those listed in the Clean Water Act 404 permits, MOAs, and correspondence with other agencies, private entities, etc. The ECP should be prepared prior to the initiation of the action. The responsible director or the designated representative(s) should approve the ECP and identify the means of determining successful completion of the commitments.

It lists and summarizes the commitments from the ECP that are related to specific construction activities (whether they are performed in-house or by contractors) that are to be followed and/or monitored in the field. The project features identified in these commitments should be made a part of any construction contract or other appropriate action.

The ROD should indicate how the public will be kept informed about the progress of the program. The ROD should indicate that additional NEPA compliance may be necessary if new information requires reconsideration of the decision.

		<span class="c1">
			After construction or implementation of the appropriate environmental commitments associated with project features identified in the ECP and ECC, it is recommended that within 1 year, and periodically thereafter as appropriate, following construction, a postdecision environmental commitment summary be prepared. This helps ensure that mitigation is being carried out in accordance with 40 CFR 1505.3. It is suggested that the summary address the status of environmental commitments (e.g., when they were implemented, the effectiveness of the mitigating activity, any suggested improvements, and others). The summary may also include recommendations for the inclusion of additional environmental project features.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The area manager or responsible director should approve the postdecision environmental commitment summary. As appropriate, it is included in the project package that is provided to the operating office or agency for future followup actions. Periodic monitoring for compliance with the continuing activities listed in the postdecision environmental compliance summary should be incorporated into the ECP.

			Most ERs are distributed by this system, except those that are still published on paper or CD-ROM. OEPC distributes ERs to all potentially affected bureaus, with the Policy and Administration office serving as the designated point of contact for Reclamation. Policy and Administration is responsible for distributing ERs within Reclamation for review and comment, and coordinating any response, as appropriate. As part of this process, Policy and Administration will notify the appropriate regional and area office ER points of contact when ERs are posted on the Web site and forward any electronic or paper documents/CD ROMS for review. Deadlines for comment are specified by OEPC or the Federal agency requesting comments in the OEPC memo that distributes the ER for review.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Over a period of time, and as a result of Reclamation training, workshops, and similar activities, certain issues seem to resurface on a regular basis within the various regions and across a broad spectrum of Reclamation activities in the West. A number of these issues are identified in the following sections, along with a short discussion and guidance, where applicable. There are no clear answers to some of these issues, which is why they recur. When these difficult questions arise, the issues may be discussed with NEPA staff in Policy and Administration, other Reclamation NEPA practitioners, and the Solicitor&rsquo;s Office to develop a solution that is in compliance with applicable regulations or procedures. This approach ensures that the decision is not arbitrary or capricious and documents the rationale as a matter of record.

	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The need for an accurate (and adequate) purpose and need statement early in the NEPA process cannot be overstated. This statement gives direction to the entire process and ensures alternatives are designed to address project goals. Simply stated, the purpose and need statement identifies what is to be accomplished. Before proceeding with a NEPA process, goals should be established and articulated. Purpose and need statements have often been inadequate in describing the necessity for the proposed action and in defining the scope of the alternatives to be considered. An inadequate definition of the purpose of and need for a project can lead to an inordinate array of alternatives&mdash;many of which will be beyond the scope of the proposed action. A concise purpose and need statement, at the initiation of the NEPA process, tends to limit the range of alternatives (thereby reducing the level of effort) and serves as a guide for selecting alternatives. In the absence of a concise purpose and need statement, the selection process will appear arbitrary and will be subject to criticism. This discussion is in the context of the EIS process but is generally applicable to the development of the need statement in the EA process as well.

		<span id="bookmark240" class="c5 c1">11.2 Public Involvement Challenges</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The public involvement process often does not reach all elements of the interested public as well as desired. The typical process of one or more scoping meetings may reach only stakeholders who are familiar with the process and who have responded, to some degree, to this process. This process does not necessarily ensure the participation or eventual buy-in of persons unfamiliar with the process or holding diverse or uncompromising interests. It is vital that creative, nontraditional means be considered and used, as appropriate, to notify and involve all segments of the public. Greater use of local newspapers, community newsletters, radio, television, and the Internet, in languages of cultures within the community, is helpful in getting better representation of community interests in the NEPA process. Personal visits with local community leaders can be vital to understanding local concerns and improving local involvement.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Because most of the public does not deal with NEPA, there is understandable confusion concerning what NEPA is and how best to participate. There are resources available to assist in this area. For instance, CEQ has published, A Citizen&rsquo;s Guide to the NEPA, Having Your Voice Heard (
		</span>
		<span class="c17 c1">
			<a class="c2" href="http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/Citizens_Guide_Dec07.pdf)">http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/Citizens_Guide_Dec07.pdf</a>

		<span class="c1">
			). Interior NEPA regulations (43 CFR 46.200) recommend that Interior agencies provide, as practicable, community-based training to promote efficiency in the NEPA process. The regulations also encourage (43 CFR 46.110) consensus-based management to improve community and interested parties&rsquo; effective participation in the NEPA process. These techniques&mdash;and others&mdash; should be applied as practicable to the NEPA process, especially when a high degree of public interest exists.

	<p class="c3">

			When working with Indian tribes, it should be kept in mind that Indian tribes are not just another stakeholder but are sovereign entities and should be consulted individually on a government-to-government basis.

		<span id="bookmark241" class="c5 c1">11.3 Establishing Realistic Timeframes for NEPA Processes</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Federal agencies at times have failed to allow sufficient time to complete the NEPA process. Most often this occurs due to a need to move forward with an action because of regulatory or other deadlines and an agency&rsquo;s failure to adequately gauge how much time is needed to complete all the necessary consultations and analyses.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			It is important to use NEPA as a tool to assist those responsible for making the best decisions possible, not just as a procedural &ldquo;hoop&rdquo; that must be jumped through. Agencies must plan in advance how much time and resources are necessary to complete the appropriate analysis and prepare the NEPA document.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			It is not unusual for a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; EIS to take 2 to 3 years. Areas in which schedules are often longer than expected include scoping, alternative development, analyses (especially if modeling is involved), integrating compliance with other environmental laws into the NEPA process, working with cooperating agencies, data collection, and responding to comments on the DEIS. When developing a schedule, resist the temptation to assume that only factual corrections on the DEIS will be needed and that the FEIS will be easy and quick to prepare. Experience has shown that this is often not the case. It is often helpful to consider the length of time it took to prepare EISs on similar actions when developing schedules and overall timeframes for completing the NEPA document.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Interior regulations (43 CFR 46.240) now require Reclamation to explicitly set time limits for the entire NEPA process. These time limits shall be developed in consultation with cooperating agencies and reflect both the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.8 and the proposal specific issues, interests, and controversies.

		<span id="bookmark242" class="c5 c1">11.4 Need for After-Project Followup</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			As part of any environmental compliance activity, some environmental commitments are invariably made. These may be requirements resulting from ESA and NHPA consultations, agreement to implement recommendations of an FWCA report, or simply the environmental commitments of a NEPA document, which are written statements of intent, made by Reclamation, to mitigate or lessen environmental consequences associated with project activities. Environmental commitments can also address activities that restore or enhance environmental quality. These commitments are made in most environmental compliance documents (e.g., EAs, biological assessments, and EISs). The Reclamation office responsible for implementing the proposed action needs to follow up on environmental commitments made as part of the Reclamation decision on an action to ensure that these commitments are being fulfilled. This includes monitoring the effectiveness of commitments that are actually implemented to ensure that they meet stated goals of mitigation and/or enhancement. The findings should be documented and made part of the project files.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Environmental commitments should be viewed as a part of the action for which the agency may be held accountable. The terms of a ROD are enforceable by agencies and private parties. (See CEQ&rsquo;s Forty Most Asked Questions, No. 34d.) Additionally, as new projects/activities are proposed, review and regulatory agencies may view past performance as an indication of future performance. Legitimate proposals for new activities can be jeopardized by past failures to honor commitments. NEPA documents, besides just listing environmental commitments, should include a process/program to identify specifically how the commitments will be met. Postdecisional monitoring is required by 40 CFR 1505.2(c), which states (in part): &ldquo;A monitoring and enforcement program shall be adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.&rdquo;

		<span id="bookmark243" class="c5 c1">11.5 Doing NEPA on Decisions Already Made</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			NEPA compliance is required before any discretionary Federal action with potentially significant environmental impacts is initiated. Decisions should not be made without full compliance with NEPA. To do this is illegal and a violation of NEPA. The one exception to this requirement is in emergency situations. Reclamation may take urgent actions necessary to control immediate impacts of an emergency situation to life, property, or important resources (43 CFR 46.150).
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Complying with NEPA after a decision has been made may cause the proposed Reclamation action to be halted, regardless of the merits of the proposed activity, because of legal challenges. Additionally, lack of a NEPA analysis may result in selecting an action that is not the best available alternative. The identification and analysis of alternatives contribute valuable information to the decisionmaking process. Other elements of the NEPA process also provide value, such as identifying measures that would avoid or mitigate significant impacts and an opportunity for the public to provide input into the decisionmaking process. Failure to carry out the NEPA process before a decision is made may result in decisions that are not beneficial to Reclamation and the environment.

		<span id="bookmark244" class="c5 c1">11.6 How Much Is Enough?</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			NEPA sets forth a process to assist Federal agencies in making more informed decisions on actions that they undertake; however, before determining how or whether to proceed with a proposed action, there are many decisions that need to be made. These process decisions and the depth of analysis and/or scope of effort needed to make them have led to considerable discussion among NEPA practitioners, often culminating in the question, &ldquo;How much is enough?&rdquo; This question frequently arises during scoping&mdash;in the identification of the depth and extent of analysis regarding specific issues and when identifying the number/range of alternatives that need to be considered. Also, it frequently occurs during consultations with other agencies regarding the amount of information needed to make a determination of effect on resources. Unfortunately, with the sole exception of page limits, there is no specific guidance provided, in either NEPA or its implementing regulations, on this question.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			There are, however, a number of references that suggest NEPA documents should be succinct statements, written in plain language, and detailed only to the point that it helps the reader understand the project, alternatives, and impacts. The sections of the CEQ NEPA regulations which address these topics are located at: 1500.1(b), 1500.4, 1501.2(b), 1501.7(a)(2) and (3), and Section 1502.22. A CEQ Guidance Memorandum, dated July 1983, also provides further discussion on this topic. The principal points coming out of the CEQ regulations and guidance are that Federal agencies should: (1) focus only on significant effects, thus allowing a cutoff point to be defined by a lack of significance in the analysis; and (2) provide an adequate range of reasonable alternatives that allows decisionmakers to make informed decisions about the proposed actions.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The CEQ regulations do not put any consistent or explicit limit on the geographic or temporal scope to be examined (the &ldquo;How far do you follow the impact?&rdquo; issue). Wherever potentially significant impacts can be identified that are the result of any of the alternatives under consideration, those impacts should be presented, regardless of geographic location or how removed in time they may be. Where the impacts of an alternative are so attenuated as to be insignificant, or impossible to determine, the analysis can stop. The scope of an analysis can be an area of significant controversy, and the reasons an analysis is limited should be documented.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			In responding to a question about how many alternatives must be considered, CEQ states that, &ldquo;What constitutes a reasonable range of alternatives depends on the nature of the proposal and the facts in each case&rdquo; (CEQ&rsquo;s Forty Most Asked Questions, No. 1b). This answer can be applied to any aspect of the NEPA process. The determination of a reasonable range must initially rest with the interdisciplinary preparers of the NEPA document. This can change during scoping, public meetings, and review of draft documents, and, of course, it is heavily influenced by the particular environmental issues involved.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			There are several additional tests, all somewhat related and overlapping, which can be applied to appropriately limit the scope (i.e., identify when to determine enough is enough). The first is the &ldquo;but for&rdquo; argument. This consists of determining what would happen in the environment &ldquo;but for&rdquo; the proposed action. Those changes that would occur in the environment regardless of whether the proposed action is implemented are not analyzed as impacts of the proposed action. This is typically determined when the no action is developed because the no action should include those actions which would occur if the proposed action is not implemented. A typical example of this limit to NEPA analysis is a housing development which is going to occur regardless of whether Reclamation agrees to supply water or not. In this example, the no action alternative should reflect a reasonable alternative water supply and include the housing development. The alternatives would also include the housing development. Therefore, since the housing development would be a feature of the environment in all alternatives, the comparison of the no action alternative to the action alternatives would not display any effects of the housing development.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			A second test revolves around the extent of agency discretion. Those actions for which Reclamation has no discretion to act differently (i.e., where there are no alternatives) are not subject to NEPA (43 CFR 46.100). An example would be where Congress has directed Reclamation to provide water to a specific community. While it may be appropriate to analyze the ways to provide that water, the provision of water to another community may not be a reasonable alternative. These situations require careful reading of the authorizing statute and involvement of the Solicitor&rsquo;s Office to ensure it is appropriate to limit the analysis.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">The Supreme Court recently articulated (in</span>

			, 124 S. Ct. 2204 (2004)) an additional test, that of reasonable causation. The Supreme Court discusses this in terms of the &ldquo;familiar doctrine of proximate cause from tort law&rdquo; and indicates that, in addition to the &ldquo;but for&rdquo; test, discussed above, a &ldquo;reasonably close causal relationship&rdquo; must exist between the proposed action and the environmental effect. Where it is believed that such reasonable causation does not exist, it may be appropriate to exclude such analysis from a NEPA document; however, this depends on legal definitions and interpretations that should be discussed with the Solicitor&rsquo;s Office before being applied to the scope of a NEPA analysis.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Finally, there is a brief discussion in section 3.5.3 describing how a Federal agency may limit the scope of analysis to a small part of a larger project when the larger project is non-Federal. There is a minimal level of Federal involvement that is necessary to trigger a requirement for analysis of the entire action as an indirect effect of the Federal action. This minimal level is not explicitly defined, but CEQ has recognized that such a limit of scope can be appropriate (see 52 FR 22517 (June 12, 1987)). As with agency discretion and reasonable causation, applying this concept to a particular project should be discussed with the Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.

		<span id="bookmark245" class="c5 c1">11.7 Climate Change</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			The subject of climate change has become a commonly raised issue in the NEPA process. As a result, it is recommended that climate change should be considered, to the extent it applies, in every NEPA analysis. There are two possible interpretations of climate change with respect to a Reclamation proposed action. The first interpretation is whether Reclamation&rsquo;s action is a potentially significant contributor to climate change. The second is what effects climate change may have upon a Reclamation proposed action. For either case, it is recommended that a discussion of climate change be included in the EA or EIS, even if it is determined that climate change is not a factor for a particular action.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3">
		<span class="c1">
			Reclamation&rsquo;s proposed actions&mdash;typically involving moving and/or managing water in different ways&mdash;generally are not considered to be potentially significant contributors to climate change. If an action involves a substantial release of greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide [CO

			Climate changes may have significant effects on how Reclamation projects operate and even whether the projects are viable, depending upon the local climate changes that may occur. The potential for climate change will likely affect all the alternatives (including no action) and triggers a potentially broad range of appropriate analysis for the NEPA document. A series of considerations are suggested to determine the appropriate analysis for any particular proposal. These considerations are:

			As these considerations are examined, different options for addressing climate change in the NEPA process become more appropriate. If climate is not relevant, or if the project timeframe is too short for climate change to have an effect, a brief statement that climate change is not relevant is appropriate.

			When the proposal may be affected by climate change, but no relevant regional/local climate projections are available, a generic discussion of climate change theory and current literature may be all that is reasonable. If the effect is potentially significant to the decision, be aware of 40 CFR 1502.22 and 43 CFR 46.125, addressing incomplete or unavailable information.

			Where a cooperating agency or partner agency has climate change analysis requirements, based upon law or regulation, it may be appropriate to use the partner&rsquo;s required analysis as long as that analysis is acceptable to Reclamation in a technical sense and appropriate for a NEPA analysis.

			When the available information indicates a potentially significant effect upon Reclamation&rsquo;s proposal, a more detailed discussion can be appropriate.

			and the question of exorbitant costs may become a factor. However, where climate change has a clear potential to significantly affect the proposal, all reasonable efforts should be made to obtain the appropriate information and analysis.

			There will be many times when NEPA compliance requirements and procedures are not clear. When questions arise, this NEPA Handbook, and the policies, regulations, and laws it references, should be consulted first. If a course of action is still not clear, regional and Policy and Administration environmental staff, as well as the Solicitor and OEPC, are available for further assistance. Also, Reclamation has established a team of individuals representing NEPA expertise in each region and in Denver. This team is available to provide assistance when difficult NEPA issues occur.
